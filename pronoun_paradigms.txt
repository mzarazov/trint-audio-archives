Thou, thee & archaic grammar  (A. Davies, R. Lipton, D. Richoux et al.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Thou", "thee", "thine"  and "thy" are pronouns that have dropped out of the 
main dialects of Modern English.  During the period of Early Modern English 
(~1470-1700), they formed the Second Person Singular of the language, and 
were standardized by the time of the King James Bible as shown below.

                                                               Present Tense
                      Subjective   Objective    Possessive     Verb Ending
                      ----------   ---------    ----------     -------------
    1st Pers. Sing.   I            me           my/mine[1]     none
    2nd Pers. Sing.   thou         thee         thy/thine[1]   -est
    3rd Pers. Sing.   he/she/it    him/her/it   his/her/its    -eth
    1st Pers. Plural  we           us           our            none
    2nd Pers. Plural  ye/you[2]    you          your           none
    3rd Pers. Plural  they         them         their          none

    [1]: "Mine" and "thine" were used before "h" and vowels, much as "an"
    was.
    [2]: "You" had replaced "ye" for most plural uses by 1600.


Here are the conjugations from that era of two common irregular verbs:


    to be - Present tense         to have - Present tense
    ---------------------         -----------------------
    I am                          I have             
    thou art                      thou hast
    he/she/it is                  he/she/it hath
    we are                        we have
    ye are                        ye have
    they are                      they have


You may have been told that "thou" and "thee" were for familiar use, and
"you" and "ye" were formal. This was not true originally, but it was
true for about two centuries, roughly 1450-1650, including Shakespeare's
time. The previously plural "you" was used in the singular to signify
politeness and respect, which left "thou" and "thee" for all the other
singular uses, ranging from endearing intimacy to bitter rudeness.
Eventually, the politer "you" drove out nearly all uses of "thee" and
"thou"; they survived mostly in poetry and religion.

Several groups continue to use these pronouns today as part of their daily 
speech (although with different grammar), including residents of Yorkshire, 
Cumbria, the East Midlands, and some rural areas of Western England. Some 
Quakers also used their Plain Speech with "thee" and "thy" until the middle 
of the 20th century.
