       <p>The <a href="fast_faq.shtml">AUE FAQ</a> has an <a href="excerpts/fxibefor.html">article on the i-before-e rule</a> that  attempts to 
show that the rule is a good and useful one, and that the objections to it may 
be swept aside. That article was written by an Englishman, the highly 
respected Mark Wainwright. This page presents an alternative view, written by an American. The 'i 
before e' rule is usually defined quite differently in the two communities.</p>
       <p>Below is an excerpt, with minor editing, from an article posted to AUE 
Tue, 27 Feb 1996 22:42:07 GMT. It was posted in response to a posting by a Ms 
Tomlinson.</p>

       <H2>Excerpt, with minor editing, from the 1996 posting:</H2>
       
        
       <P><i>There was a robust thread on this topic about a year ago. I also 
  participated in an extended discussion of it in the ILink WordPlay Conference 
  a couple of years ago. Both discussions went the same way. People kept piling 
  on more and more qualifications to the rule until it seemed as though the rule 
  might eventually become longer than the list of words that obeyed it.</i></P>
       <A name=extlist></a>
       <H3><i>Extensions to the rule that have been suggested:</i></H3>
       <P><i>Early in both discussions I submitted a list 
  of words that were exceptions to the rule. People then took exception to some 
  of the words in my list, citing extensions to the rule that excluded them. 
  Some of the extensions were:</i></P>
       <UL>
         
        <LI><i>The rule only applies to digraphs, so words like "deity" and "science" 
    don't count. 
         
        </i>
        <LI><i>The rule "i before e except after c" should be extended to include 
    "except when said 'ay' as in 'neighbor' and 'weigh'". 
         
        </i>
        <LI><i>The rule only applies to digraphs that have the /i:/ ('ee') 
    pronunciation, as in 'piece'. (Note the conflict between this and the 
    previous item.) 
         
        </i>
        <LI><i>The rule doesn't apply to words that are recent imports from foreign 
    languages, such as "gneiss", "dreidel", and "enceinte". 
         
        </i>
        <LI><i>The rule doesn't apply to the large number of plurals of words ending in 
    "cy" ("fallacies", "frequencies", "vacancies", ... ) because in the UK &#8211; in 
    traditional RP &#8211; "cies" is pronounced with the "i" of "pin", even though it 
    is pronounced with the "ee" of "feed" by most World-English speakers and by 
    younger UK speakers. </i></LI>
       </UL>
       <P><i>I don't think any of these extensions are 
  useful, with the exception of the one concerning "neighbor" and "weigh". If 
  the rule were to be useful it would have to be useable by all World-English 
  speakers, and it would have to be applicable to all words they were likely to 
  use. Even the "ay" extension is not very significant, because it covers only 
  one of the several sounds that the digraph "ei" can have.</i></P>
       <A name=exceptlist></a>
       <H3><i>Examples of exceptions to the rule:</i></H3>
       <p><I>Sticking for the moment to the basic 
  rule, "i before e except after c", which is the only version I ever heard 
  until a couple of years ago, here are some exceptions I've noted (I've added 
  five of Ms Tomlinson's words to my old list):</i></p>
       <p class="bq"><I>
        
       beige, cleidoic, codeine, conscience, deify, deity, deign,<BR>
       dreidel, eider, eight, either, feign, feint, feisty,<BR>
       foreign, forfeit, freight, gleization, gneiss, greige,<BR>
       greisen, heifer, heigh-ho, height, heinous, heir, heist,<BR>
       leitmotiv, neigh, neighbor, neither, peignoir, prescient,<BR>
       rein, science, seiche, seidel, seine, seismic, seize, sheik,<BR>
       society, sovereign, surfeit, teiid, veil, vein, weight,<BR>
       weir, weird
        
       </i></p>
       
       <P><i>This list could obviously be extended by 
  adding more derivatives of Latin "scire", and by adding inflected forms of 
  some of the basic words listed. The list has "conscience", "prescient", and 
  "science", but there are also, for example, "omniscient" and "nescient". To 
  "eight" could be added "eighty", "eighteen", and "eighth". And the list could 
  be greatly extended by adding the plurals of all words ending in "cy".</i></P>
       <P><i>(Is someone going to cite a word ending in 
  "cy" that doesn't form its plural with "cies"? I can't think of any at the 
  moment, given that I'm excluding capitalized words from my discussion.)</i></P>
       <P><i>With regard to the extension added by some 
  people for "neighbor" and "weigh", and the fact that this is only a start 
  toward covering all the sounds of "ei", I have broken down my list according 
  to the six different sounds "ei" had in that list. In doing so I have excluded 
  cases where the "ei" or "ie" was not a digraph. Here is the list as so 
  reorganized:</i></P>
       <A name=asinweigh></a>
       <H3><i>/eI/ as in 'pate' and 'weigh':</i></H3>
       <p class="bq"><i>beige, deign, dreidel, eight, feign, feint, freight,<BR>
       gleization, greige, heinous, neigh, neighbor, peignoir,<BR>
       rein, seiche, seine, veil, vein, weight</i></p>
       <A name=asinheight></a>
       <H3><i>/AI/ as in 'bite' and 'height':</i></H3>
       <p class="bq"><i>cleidoic, feisty, gneiss, greisen, heigh-ho, height,<BR>
       heist, leitmotiv, seidel, seismic, eider</i></p>
       <A name=asinseize></a>
       <H3><i>/i:/ as in 'peat' and 'seize':</i></H3>
       <p class="bq"><i>codeine, either, neither, protein, seize, teiid</i></p>
       <A name=asinsurfeit></a>
       <H3><i>/@/ as in 'bacon' and 'surfeit':</i></H3>
       <p class="bq"><i>conscience, foreign, forfeit, prescient, sovereign, surfeit</i></p>
       <A name=asinheifer></a>
       <H3><i>/E/ as in 'pet' and 'heifer':</i></H3>
       <p class="bq"><i>heifer, heir</i></p>
       <A name=asinweird></a>
       <H3><i>/I/ as in 'pit' and 'weird':</i></H3>
       <p class="bq"><i>weir, weird</i></p>
       <A name=asinpiece></a>
       <H3><i>Exceptions with "ei" or "ie" pronounced as in "species" or "seize":</i></H3>
       <P><i>For those people who insist the rule apply 
  only to words where the digraph has the /i:/ ("ee") sound, and excluding words 
  ending in "cies", here is a list of words that have at least one accepted 
  pronunciation with the /i:/ 
  sound:</i></P>
       <p class="bq"><i>caffeine, casein, codeine, deil (Scots, devil), disseize,<BR>
       either, geisha, inveigle, keister (slang, buttocks),<BR>
       keister, leisure, monteith, neither, obeisance,<BR>
       phenolphthalein, phthalein, protein, seize, seizin, sheik,<BR>
       sheila (Australian slang for "girl", not capitalized),<BR>
       specie, species, teiid</i></p>
       <A name=conclusion></a>
       <H3><i>My suggested conclusion:</i></H3>
       <P><i>My last remarks in the ILink discussion 
  were:</i></P>
       <P><i>"Instead of trying to defend the 'rule' or 
  'guideline', "'i' before 'e' except after 'c'", why don't we all just agree 
  that it is dumb and useless, and be content just to laugh at 
it?"</i></P>
