      <div class=tag>53. Elementary my dear hurdy-gurdy-birdie (Jitze Couperus)</div>
      <p><div class=question><b>Q:</b> Dr Watson and I were repairing home 
            after a pleasant evening at the pub. 
            <P>We were strolling home past one of London's great teaching 
            hospitals (which delicacy forbids me to name - but the one across 
            the bridge from the Houses of Parliament) 
            <P>As we walked toward the nurse's quarters we encountered a 
            collection of aspirant Florence Nightingales who were apparently 
            were just coming off duty. 
            <P>Most were still dressed in their starched uniforms with funny 
            little caps, but one group had already changed into summer frocks, 
            one nurse in particular with a delightful decolletage. 
            <P>That latter group had caught Watson's eye and he drew my 
            attention to them. What he might have said was something like "Take 
            a look at those girls out of uniform" but instead he opted to use 
            three simple words of slang - each of which I presume he had learned 
            from his time with the army in India or Mesopotamia. 
            <P>Can you tell me what were the three words he uttered? </P></div>
      <p><div class=answer><b>A:</b> Shufti Mufti Binti 
            <P>Shufti - derived from Arabic - to take a look at. (See also "Take 
            a butchers", "Take a dekko", "Take a gander") 
            <P>Mufti - orginally Arabic for a Muslim legal scholar, at some 
            point assumed the meaning in English of "civilian dress" as opposed 
            to "in uniform". 
            <P>Bint - Arabic for a woman, pluralized in British army slang to 
            Binti. </P></div

            for Mohs's list of minerals with these hardnesses is "The Girls Can

      <div class=tag>62. Length matters (Adrian Bailey)</div>
      <p><div class=question><b>Q:</b> Which is the longest English word 
            that has two distinct/discrete meanings? (eg. bass - fish vs. bass - 
            musical instrument)" 
            <P>And some guidelines: 
            <P>The difference should *not* simply be (a) that the word can be 
            used as more than one part of speech (eg. smile - verb vs. smile - 
            noun) or (b) that the word can be used figuratively (eg. green - 
            colour vs. green - inexperienced/envious) or extended (eg. bridge - 
            structure over river vs. bridge - structure over gums), though a 
            combination of (a) and (b) may be acceptable (eg. green - colour vs. 
            green - putting surface). </P></div>
      <p><div class=answer><b>A:</b> No totally official answer, but an example is 
            "constitutional" (a walk; relating to a legal constitution) - but 
            the lexemes need not be different parts of speech

      <p><div class=answer><b>A:</b> In grass, or in the grass, or in the poem 
            'Leisure'. 
            <P>W. H. Davies was a Welsh hobo who, after losing a foot in 
            America, became a celebrated poet, feted and supported by the likes 
            of D. H. Lawrence and George Bernard Shaw. His most famous poem, 
            'Leisure', apparently came 14th in a 1996 poll to find the most 
            popular poems in the English language. (That clue is a bit naughty. 
            It's from one sentence in a book review in The Spectator. I can't 
            find another reference so can't be sure what the poll was all about, 
            nor indeed whether Davies really did come 14th.) The poem is as 
            follows: 
            <BLOCKQUOTE>What is this life if, full of care,<BR>We have no time 
              to stand and stare?--<BR>
              <P>No time to stand beneath the boughs,<BR>And stare as long as 
              sheep and cows:<BR>
              <P>No time to see, when woods we pass,<BR>Where squirrels hide 
              their nuts in grass:<BR>
              <P>No time to see, in broad daylight,<BR>Streams full of stars, 
              like skies at night:<BR>
              <P>No time to turn at Beauty's glance,<BR>And watch her feet, how 
              they can dance:<BR>
              <P>No time to wait till her mouth can<BR>Enrich that smile her 
              eyes began?<BR>
              <P>A poor life this if, full of care,<BR>We have no time to stand 
              and stare.<BR></P></BLOCKQUOTE>[the poem and the poet are all over

      <p><div class=answer><b>A:</b> Simon Bolivar, in a letter shortly before he died.
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>I have arrived at only a few sure conclusions: 1. For 
              us, America is ungovernable. 2. He who serves a revolution ploughs 
              the sea. 3. The only thing we can do in America is emigrate. 4. 
              This country will eventually fall into the hands of the unbridled 
              mob, and will proceed to almost imperceptible petty tyrannies of 
              all complexions and races. 5. Devoured as we are by every kind of 
              crime and annihilated by ferocity, Europeans will not go to the 
              trouble of conquering us. 6. If it were possible for any part of 
              the world to revert to primordial chaos, that would be America's 
              final state. </BLOCKQUOTE>By 'America', Bolivar meant 'South (or 
            perhaps Latin) America'. 
            <P>[as far as I can tell, the full Bolivar quote appears only once 
            on the Web and the words are slightly different; but it's still 
            probably far, far too easy; it is, however, an early (1830) use of 
            an exclusive 'America'] </P></div

      <p><div class=question><b>Q:</b> The caption to the photograph that

            href="Inshop.jpg" class="sml %l">Inshop.jpg</A> 
            says "that's me in the middle" but the panel is unsure whether the 
            caption writer is referring to the person closest to the middle of 
            the picture (with glasses) or the person in the middle of the three 
            people. 
            <P>So we are invoking the collective wisdom of aue to determine 
            which it is and who it might be. A more recent picture of this 
            person may be found in the collection at

            although our spies tell us that even that picture is not 
            particularly recent. Can you identify this person and/or his claim 
            to eponymous immortality? 
            <P>(The person in this picture is probably the only person who can 
            provide the definitive answer to which of the people in the picture 
            he really is - so he is hereby appointed panel member for this
