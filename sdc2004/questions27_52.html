      <div class=tag>27. A load of tat (Garry Vass)</div>
      <p><div class=question><b>Q:</b> As they were robbing a bank, the one 
            who told them to do it got killed. So they had to take the fall for 
            it, except for the one whose best friend was invisible. That one got 
            sent to a place about half-way between Clear Creek and Pine Town. In 
            what year did they rob the bank? </div>
      <p><div class=answer><b>A:</b> 1972 
            <P>Explanation: "In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by 
            a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly 
            escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles 
            underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as 
            soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, 
            and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team." 
            <P>Murdock was sent to the VA Hospital in Westwood, CA. His 
            invisible dog was named Billy.

      <div class=tag>30. A nasty four-letter word (Jerry Friedman)</div>
      <p><div class=question><b>Q:</b> Earlier this year, while taking his 
            groceries to his car, an SDC panelist saw an SUV with the license 
            plate BRYOZOAN. Naturally excited, he asked the driver about a word 
            that he (the panelist) thought meant "colony of bryozoa". The driver 
            patiently explained that it was an old word for any colony of 
            aquatic animals. Glad not to stay confused, the panelist headed 
            toward a nearby seasonal competition. 
            <P>What was the word? </P></div>
      <p><div class=answer><b>A:</b> asty (which happens to be an anagram for "stay",

      <div class=tag>35. Heah come da judge, da judge is a comin&#8217; (Jitze Couperus)</div>
      <p><div class=question><b>Q:</b> In the early 1970s, an American 
            comedian hosted a popular comedy show on television named after 
            himself. This show popularised a number of "characters" depicted by 
            the comedian. Through the mouth of one of these characters, he 
            unwittingly established the etymological root for a term that is 
            used today to describe certain types of software. 
            <P>Identify that term and the comedian. 
            <P>For extra sheep, name the prominent figure in the computer 
            industry who adopted this term for use in the context of describing 
            software. </P></div>
      <p><div class=answer><b>A:</b> WYSIWYG, Flip Wilson. 
            <P>It was Mr. Seybold, according to his son Andrew, who first used 
            "what you see is what you get" in reference to computerized word 
            processing, after watching "The Flip Wilson Show," on which Mr. 
            Wilson used the phrase to describe his female character Geraldine. 
            <P>The phrase came to be abbreviated as WYSIWYG and was popularized 
            by computer systems developed at the Palo Alto Research Center of 
            Xerox in the early 1970's. 
            <P>(From the obit for John W. Seybold, a pioneer in the field of

            <P>Your task: Present a surname that could fill that blank in the 
            third position on the list, and provide evidence that that surname 
            fills it appropriately according to the relevant criterion. Number 
            of letters is not significant. </P></div>
      <p><div class=answer><b>A:</b> The surname of any person or fictional character 
            whose first name is Kentucky is acceptable, as long as satisfactory 
            verification is provided. (The given surnames are those of Georgia, 
            Tennessee, Indiana, and Michigan; Kentucky is the only state 
            adjacent to both Indiana and Tennessee.)

      <div class=tag>50. Apportionment (Dr Whom)</div>
      <p><div class=question><b>Q:</b> If all the states in the U.S. had 
            equal population density[1], there are exactly four states that 
            would have the same number of representatives in Congress as they do 
            in real life (as of the 2000 Census reapportionment). Name three of 
            them. 
            <P>[1] Equivalently, if Congressional apportionment were determined 
            on the basis of land area, rather than population. </P></div>
      <p><div class=answer><b>A:</b> Delaware, Vermont, West Virginia, Texas.

            <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=-2><I>I don't think there's an easy way to 
              solve this without just doing the math. But the algorithm by which 
              apportionment is determined is available on the Web, and someone 
              could probably write a program to carry out the algorithm and then 
              plug in the area figures instead of the population figures as the 
              base data and see what happens. It took me a few hours to do it in 
              perl, and I have very little perl experience; someone more 
              programming-savvy than me could probably do it faster.</I></FONT>

      <div class=tag>51. Apple Pie in the sky (Jitze Couperus)</div>
      <p><div class=question><b>Q:</b> In order to be able compute fees 
            associated with the filing, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
            asked Google to estimate the amount of money that their planned 
            Initial Public Offering (IPO) would bring in. They responded with 
            the figure $2,718,281,828 . 
            <P>What rationale did they have for this number, and for extra 
            sheep, why might $2,147,483,647 have been seen as a more appropriate 
            number? </P></div>
      <p><div class=answer><b>A:</b> They were following the dictum that this number 
            should represent a rational approximation. (This figure is a 
            rational approximation of 'e') 
            <P>The second number is known as Maxint, any number larger than this 
            may cause problems in a 32-bit world.

      <div class=tag>52. Commonality (Dr Whom)</div>
      <p><div class=question><b>Q:</b> What does the first chairman of the 
            New York Port Authority have in common with a particular physicist 
            (the latter having been born in 1852 and having taught at what is 
            now the University of Birmingham)? 
            <P>Extra credit for naming a third person who, in the judgment of 
            the Panel, also shares this characteristic. </P></div>
      <p><div class=answer><b>A:</b> The men referred to are Eugenius Outerbridge and 
            John Henry Poynting, and their names also serve as descriptions of 
            the items that were named after them. That is, the Outerbridge 
            Crossing is named after Outerbridge and it is the _outermost bridge_ 
            between New Jersey and New York. The Poynting vector is named after 
            Poynting and it _points_ in the direction in which an 
            electromagnetic wave propagates. </div
