              <p>A report on the 22 June 2008 Oxboink was posted 
                to the newsgroup by Stephanie and is reproduced here:</p>
              <p class="bq">This past Sunday eight representatives of the east bank branch of AUE met in Summertown, Oxford. This is,
                unfortunately, not a very good set of notes due to your humble author having been sat at one end of a rather
                long table and therefore undoubtedly having missed many fascinating topics bandied about or even discussed
                seriously at the other end of same. This is also due to my not having followed Laura's excellent example
                (one seen on television and given every encouragement, I must admit) of having a notebook always close at
                hand. Mea culpa, mea culpa.</p>
              <p class="bq">Attending were Laura, Paul, Mike P and spouses, Katy, and myself. We met at Portabello (yes, the mipspelling
                was discussed) Restaurant on what turned out to be a bright warm sunny day while much of the rest of the
                country suffered gale force winds. It was doubtless due to the season that Celtic brooches were not in evidence.
                The restaurant is located on a street interestingly named (but not discussed) 'South Parade', which is (regular
                readers will have guessed) located to the *north* of North Parade. (Wikipedia will explain it all should
                you be interested, I certainly was.)</p>
              <p class="bq">Having apologised and introduced at some length, I can report that the following topics were discussed at
                the end of the table where I was and whilst I was there (I had a train to catch that didn't leave nearly
                enough time for talking):</p>
              <p class="bq">--the myriad wonderful things about the best place to holiday in Switzerland, which explained why Laura's
                been away from the group for a couple of weeks; said wonderful things included fabulous food and blissful
                lake views and did we mention the choice of fabulous food (daily specials, healthy living, and -- something
                else, I knew that lack of a notebook was going to be fatal!);</p>
              <p class="bq">--the phenomenon of being convinced you know what someone will look like when you've only ever talked with
                them by telephone and then being exceedingly flustered when you meet them and they look nothing like the
                person who exists only in your mind's eye; examples adduced included one member of this group, an expected
                short ginger-haired German speaker who turned out to be a tall dark Italian type, and the purchaser of Laura's
                son's flat (who promptly appeared at the restaurant, thereby causing some immediate flusterment), as well
                as svelte northern Moira ;</p>
              <p class="bq">--being acquired by a cat and how to deal with it (some discussion of salmon);</p>
              <p class="bq">--different kinds of mint (spear-, pepper-, other) and whether any of us could tell them apart;</p>
              <p class="bq">--the latest trends in artisanal chocolate.</p>
              <p class="bq">This last portion admittedly took a good deal of attention, including as it did the reading of interestingly
                translated packaging, the discovery that when said packaging had been removed there was no way to identify
                the various chocolate bars other than to keep eating them, and -- well, eating. A portion of this research
                effort included 99% (Laura, was it 99? My scribbled notes in the not-big-enough notebook which was used too
                late and not well enough are so tiny that I can't tell whether it was 98 or 99) cocoa chocolate, its instructions
                for tasting (yes, you need to be carefully taught), and a mysterious graph explaining same. No European funds
                other than our own were used in the conducting of this research.</p>
              <p class="bq">Flavours included 'macadamia of Carpentaria' (in honour of Antipodean absent members), 'lavender of high
                Provence', 'peppermint (see above) of Mekong' and 'star anise of Sichuan'. I think they did, the evidence
                is now long gone. We worked hard at our research, you understand. Whilst there is definitely a trend for
                using stronger spices and peppery flavours with/in/against the chocolate, most members of the panel found
                most of the chocs still rather delicately flavoured; some expressed a desire for chunkier more definite textures
                with, for example, the macadamia variety. Oddly for AUE, the repeated use of 'of' instead of apostrophes
                didn't attract any attention.</p>
              <p class="bq">My notes expire here and so do I, temporarily, being off on a short holiday myself on Friday. I do have
                some pics, though, and would be happy to forward them to anyone who could post them -- advice or a destination
                e-mail to send them to, please?</p>
              <p class="bq">I do apologise for the inadequate nature of this report and thank everyone for coming. It was lovely to
                put faces to names, the food and drink were great, and a good time was had, I hope, by all.</p>
