      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This universal
      image calls to mind an overweight soprano brandishing a spear
      and wearing a Viking helmet. It is clearly rooted in Wagnerian
      opera, specifically &quot;The Ring of the Nibelungen&quot;.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The &quot;fat
      lady&quot; is probably best associated with character Brunhilda
      in &quot;The Valkure&quot;, &quot;Siegfreid&quot;, or &quot;Twilight
      of the Gods&quot;. At the endings of these operas, Brunhilda
      is asleep, singing, and dead (respectively); leaving the opera,
      &quot;Siegfried&quot; as the most logical choice.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Which &quot;fat
      lady&quot;? To complicate things, the 20th century has not produced
      a noticeably overweight Brunhilda. Opera buffs, however, agree
      that the two most likely candidates are Sweden's Birgit Nilsson
      and Norway's Kirsten Flagstad. Pictures can be found at...<BR>

      Who said it? The most satisfying response we received about this

      believe the actual phrase was [&#133;]. It occurred in Seattle
      in June of 1978. Seattle and Washington D. C. were playing each

      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center"><CENTER><FONT
       COLOR="#3366ff" FACE="Times New Roman">Rule, Britannia, rule
      the waves; Britons never will be slaves.&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Britannia is
      the national emblem and poetic name of Britain (arguably the
      oldest surviving national emblem in Europe), and an article about
      Britannia is relevant to English speakers because her name has
      been used in practically every form of figurative language to
      allude to Britain and the British Isles.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Incredible
      to relate, the earliest known image of Britannia is in the ancient
      town of Aphrodisias, Turkey.&nbsp; There, in a Roman temple dedicated
      to Aphrodite (dated 20-60 CE), is a relief entitled, &#147;Claudius
      Conquers Britannia&#148;.&nbsp; This gruesome sculpture shows
      a scantily clad, bare breasted Britannia twisting in agony as
      a Roman warrior (the Emperor Claudius) prepares to slay her.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Nearly a century
      later, Britannia was revived and made her first appearance in
      Britain on a coin issued by the Roman Emperor Hadrian.&nbsp;
      This image shows a seated woman with a spear across her left
      arm and resting her left elbow on a large bossed shield. Her
      bare left foot is visible, and she is dressed in Roman style.
      Her expression is one of dejection or sadness.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Coins that
      followed in Hadrian&#146;s reign echo her sad expression and
      posture.&nbsp; But on a coin issued in the reign of Antonius
      Pius, she is depicted with a pleasant, if not happy, expression.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Near the end
      of the Roman occupation, there is an interesting literary reference
      to her in Claudian&#146;s, &#147;On the Consulate of Stilicho&#148;,
      where he describes her as wearing woad.&nbsp; As there are no
      images to accompany this reference, we don&#146;t know if he
      intended &#147;woad&#148; to mean dyed clothing, or as the blue
      skin pigment characteristically worn by the Picts.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After the retreat
      of the Romans in 410 CE, Britannia&#146;s image lay dormant for
      over a millennium.&nbsp; Gesithas member Andy explains, &#147;&#133;Alas,
      I know of no Britannias from the Sub Roman period.&nbsp; I don&#146;t
      think she pops up on coins again until Charles II&#146;s mistress
      modeled for her.&nbsp; If you turn up anything, please post it,
      as I would love to know.&nbsp; Perhaps when the concept of Britain
      as a whole was lost, and I suspect that was a Roman construct
      too, people gradually reverted to more local loyalties.&nbsp;
      It is hard to erase 350 years of history, but on the other hand,
      Gildas, who writes soon after the Roman period seems to know
      remarkably little about it&#133;&#148;</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In 1665, the
      artist Philip Roettier revived her image to adorn the halfpenny
      and several other copper coins of the period.&nbsp; Roettier&#146;s
      likeness is faithful to the Hadrian coin:&nbsp; Britannia is
      seated, bare left foot exposed, holding a spear in her left hand
      and her left elbow rests upon a shield.&nbsp; However, there
      are also significant differences:&nbsp; the shield is emblazoned
      with the Union Jack, and she demonstrates a confident, erect
      posture.&nbsp; Her right hand, rather than supporting her chin
      in an expression of sadness, holds a branch of vegetation slightly
      forward.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Samuel Pepys
      (1667) commented, &#147;&#133;The king&#146;s new medal, where,
      in little, there is Mrs. Stewart&#146;s face&#133; and a pretty
      thing it is, that he should choose her face to represent Britannia
      by&#133;&#148;.&nbsp; As mentioned above, Frances Stewart was
      thought to be a mistress of Charles II.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The same image
      was applied to bank notes, the first of which appeared in 1694.&nbsp;
      In this year, the newly formed Bank of England adopted for its
      seal an image of &quot;&#133;Brittannia sitting on looking on
      a Bank of Mony&#133;&quot;(sic. NOTE: this citation has been
      carefully proofed ).&nbsp;&nbsp; Often, a beehive is used to
      represent either the bank or British society (as can be seen
      on today&#146;s ten-pound note).</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This image
      of Britannia was relatively stable until the Victorian era; and
      during this era images of a confident, majestic, sometimes defiant
      Britannia abounded.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The artist
      R. H. Solly created the first helmeted Britannia in 1818 as a
      proposal for a new series of &#147;inimitable&#148; one pound
      notes.&nbsp; While the image was not used, artist Stephen Gooden
      recalled it almost exactly for the Britannia used on the blue
      five-pound note (Series &#147;B&#148;, 1957).&nbsp; This Britannia
      sports long, curly hair, robust cheeks, and a compassionate expression.&nbsp;
      She is wearing a Grecian crested helmet that is inlaid with seashell
      patterns.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are two
      known images where Britannia is shown weeping: &nbsp;on a medal
      commemorating the death of Abercrombie and on a leaflet (dated
      1819) advocating a gold standard.&nbsp; In the latter of these,
      Britannia sits amidst an empty cornucopia, a wounded lion, and
      a damaged Union Jack shield.&nbsp; Her spear is broken, and in
      the background, there is a gallows and a cluster of people (who
      are, presumably, intending to hang her).</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Daniel Maclise,
      RA, introduced the notion of presenting Britannia in Saxon clothing
      in 1855.&nbsp; Using his daughter as the model, he depicted Britannia
      as the wife of a thegn, her dress&nbsp; reminiscent of the early
      to mid 8th century.&nbsp; Her cape appears to be North Umbrian
      style, with an ornamental clasp indicating a rank of nobility.&nbsp;
      In her left hand, she carries an unprovenanced spear, resembling
      many of those dated to the 10th century.&nbsp; In her right hand
      is an olive branch.&nbsp; To her left is a beehive, and behind
      her is a shield with the Cross of Saint George.&nbsp; This portrait
      of Britannia was printed on banknotes until 1961, and was revived
      several years ago for the new twenty-pound note (purple, &#147;E&#148;
      Series).</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Britannia&#146;s
      pose in the 2nd century Roman coin is captured almost exactly
      on the current five-pound note (the series E, or &#147;green&#148;
      series, notes). There, a large shield emblazoned with the Cross
      of St. George replaces Britannia&#146;s buckler, and in her right
      hand is a branch of vegetation, commonly assumed to be an olive
      branch. Her Roman dress is replaced by a Saxon dress and cape.
      Her bare left foot is resting on an elevation.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Royal Mint
      has traditionally opted to connect Britannia with maritime accomplishments,
      and some of the most dramatic images have been produced on this
      theme. Coins and medals produced by the Royal Mint over the years
      have shown Britannia carrying tall ships, lighthouses, globes,
      sextants, and almost any other maritime artifact you can think
      of.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Perhaps the
      most striking portrayal of Britannia in recent times is the GBP
      100 pound coin issued in 1998. Here, she stands on a wind-swept
      precipitous rock looking out over the sea. Evidently fashioned
      after Athena, she is wearing a crested helmet and a loose fitting,
      daringly immodest, toga. She carries a trident in her right hand,
      and a shield embossed with the Union Jack in her left hand. Following
      tradition, her bare left foot is visible.&nbsp; The artist for
      this coin was Philip Nathan.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Nathan also
      designed our seven-sided fifty pence coin.&nbsp; The reverse
      of this coin shows a helmeted Britannia in Grecian dress carrying
      a spetum in her right hand and leaning on a shield emblazoned
      with the Union Jack.&nbsp; And finally, Nathan&#146;s design
      for the Queen&#146;s Near East Service Medal shows Britannia
      riding a chariot through the waves.&nbsp; Her chariot is a giant
      seashell, and it is drawn by water-horses.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These two completely
      different portraits, Britannia as a Saxon noblewoman and Britannia
      as a Grecian styled demi-godess, coexist happily together today.&nbsp;
      This diversity also underscores the point that her image has
      been constantly evolving over the course of two millennia, and
      will continue to do so.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Unlike America&#146;s
      &#147;Liberty&#148;, or France&#146;s &#147;La Semeuse&#148;,
      there are no images showing Britannia directly interacting with
      her Britons in a social or political context.&nbsp; Perhaps this
      difference reflects a quiet satisfaction in the British mind
      set with their noble and time-proven national emblem.</FONT></P>

      <P class="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I would like
      to thank the Bank of England for their considerate and thorough
      assistance in preparing this article.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also to those
      Gesithas who answered the call.</FONT></P>

      Depending on whether you include all railway bridges, only name

      Tower Bridge was the<BR>
