<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The book is a slim volume (70 pages) of 25
Yorkshire Dialect poems.&nbsp; One of these &quot;A Dalesman's
Litany&quot;, with slightly different wording, is much quoted
in Yorkshire and regularly sung in English folk clubs.&nbsp; It
is wrongly considered as &quot;Traditional&quot; in the folk scene.<BR>
<BR>
The book is rare in paper copies, and of great interest to Yorkshire
people with a bent towards the Yorkshire Dialect.&nbsp; As one
who was born in Hull and lives in Halifax :-), I am proud to be
a Yorshireman</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In reading this one must remember that these
poems were written about 1900.&nbsp; Moorman is describing a world
which is long forgotten and totally alien to a modern reader.&nbsp;
His peasants no longer exist. Modern farmers would consider the
word an insult.&nbsp; I can think of no acquaintance who would
consider him/her self an artisan.&nbsp; In the hundred years which
have passed since then the Yorkshire dialect has changed quite
dramatically.&nbsp; Even the English language has changed so much
that I had to look up several footnotes in the dictionary.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It has been noted, rightly,&nbsp; by several people from uk.local.yorkshire
that many words and pronunciations used are now only found in
the Geordie, Cumbrian, or Lowland Scots dialects.&nbsp; Prof Moorman
clearly used the dialect as he heard it in about 1900,&nbsp;&nbsp;
These must have been lost in Yorkshire over the last one hundred
years.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="Preface"></A><FONT SIZE="+2">Preface</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Abut two years ago I published a collection
of Yorkshire dialect poems,&nbsp; chosen from many authors and
extending over a period of two hundred and fifty years(1). The
volume was well received, and there are abundant signs that the
interest in dialect literature is steadily growing in all parts
of the county and beyond its borders. What is most encouraging
is to find that the book has found an entrance into the homes
of Yorkshire peasants and artisans where the works of our great
national poets are unknown. I now essay the more venturesome task
of publishing dialect verses of my own. Most of the poems contained
in this little volume have appeared, anonymously, in the Yorkshire
press, and I have now decided to reissue them in book form and
with my name on the title-page.<BR>
<BR>
A generation ago the minor poet was, in the eyes of most Englishmen,
an object of ridicule. Dickens and Thackeray had done their worst
with him: we knew him - or her - as Augustus Snodgrass or Blanche
Amory - an amiable fool or an unamiable minx. The twentieth century
has already, in its short course, done much to remove this prejudice,
and the minor poet is no longer expected to be apologetic; his
circle of readers, though small, is sympathetic, and the outside
public is learning to tolerate him and to recognise that it is
as natural and wholesome for him to write and publish his verses
as it is for the minor painter to depict and exhibit in public
his interpretation of the beauty and power which he sees in human
life and in nature. All this is clear gain, and the time may not
be far distant when England will again become what it was in Elizabethan
days - a nest of<BR>
singing birds, where te minor poets will be able to take their
share in the chorus of song, leaving the chief parts in the oratorio
to the Shakespeares and Spensers of tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
The twenty-five poems of which this volume consists are meant
to serve a double purpose. Most of them are character-sketches
or dramatic studies, and my wish is to bring before the notice
of my readers the habits of mind of certain Yorkshire men and
women whose acquaintance I have made. For&nbsp; ten years I have
gone up hill and down dale in the three Ridings, intent on the
study of the sounds, words and idioms of the local folk-speech.
At first my object was purely philological, but soon I came to
realise that men and women were more interesting than words and
phrases, and my attention was attracted from dialect speech to
dialect speakers. Among Yorkshire farmers, farm labourers, fishermen,
miners and mill workers I discovered a vitality and an outlook
upon life of which I, a bourgeois professor, had no previous knowledge.
Not, only had I never met such men before, but I had not read
about them in literature, or seen their portraits painted on canvas.
The wish to give a literary interpretation of the world into which
I had been privileged to enter grew every day more insistent,
and this volume is the fulfilment of that wish.<BR>
<BR>
Of all forms of literature, whether in Verse or prose, the dramatic
monologue seemed to me the aptest for the exposition of character
and habits of mind. It is the creation - or recreation - of Robert
Browning, the most illuminating interpreter of the workings of
the human mind that England has produced since Shakespeare died.
My first endeavour was therefore<BR>
<BR>
to watch<BR>
The Master work, and catch<BR>
Hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true play.<BR>
<BR>
I have been, I fear, a clumsy botcher in applying the lessons
that Browning was able to teach, but the dramatic monologues of
which this volume is largely composed owe whatever art they may
possess to his example. My dramatic studies are drawn from life.
For example, the local preacher who expresses his views on the
rival merits of Church and Chapel is a Wharfedale acquaintance,
and the farmer in 'Cambodunum' who declares that &quot;eddication's
nowt but muckment&quot; actually expressed this view to a Chief
Inspector of Schools, a member of the West Riding Education Committee,
and myself, when we visited him on his farm. I do not claim that
I have&nbsp; furnished literal transcripts of what I heard in
my conversations with my heroes and heroines, but my purpose throughout
has been to hold a mirror up to Nature, to give a faithful interpretation
of thought and character, and to show my readers some of the ply
of mind and habits of life that still prevail among Yorkshiremen
whose individuality has not been blunted by convention and who
have the courage to express their reasoned or instinctive views
of life and society.<BR>
<BR>
But the interpretation of the minds of Yorkshire peasants and
artisans for the benefit of the so-called general reader is only
the secondary object which I have in view. My primary appeal is
not to those who have the full chorus of English song, from Chaucer
to Masefield, at their beck and call, but to a still larger class
of men and women who are not general readers of literature at
all, and for whom most English poetry is a closed book. In my
dialect wanderings through Yorkshire I discovered that while there
was a hunger for poetry in the hearts of the people, the great
masterpieces of our national song made little or no appeal to
them. They were bidden to a feast of rarest quality and profusion,
but it consisted of food that they could not assimilate. Spenser,
Milton, Pope, Keats, Tennyson, all spoke to them in a language
which they could not understand, and presented to them a world
of thought and life in which they had no inheritance. But the
Yorkshire dialect verse which circulated through the<BR>
dales in chap-book or Christmas almanac was welcomed everywhere.
Two memories come before my mind as I write. One is that of a
North Riding farm labourer who knew by heart many of the dialect
poems of the Eskdale poet, John Castillo, and was in the habit
of reciting them to himself as he followed the plough. The other
is that of a blind girl in a West Riding village who had committed
to memory scores of the poems of John Hartley, and, gathering
her neighbours round her kitchen fire of a winter evening, regaled
them with 'Bite Bigger', 'Nelly 'o Bob's' and other verses of
the Halifax poet. My object is to add something to this chorus
of local song. It was the aim of Addison in his 'Spectator' essays
to bring &quot;philosophy out of closets and libraries, schools
and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables
and in coffeehouses&quot;; and, in like manner, it should be the
aim of the writer of dialect verse to bring poetry out of the
coteries of the people of leisure and to make it dwell in artisans'
tenements and in cottagers' kitchens. &quot;Poetry,&quot; declared
Shelley, &quot;is the record of the best and happiest moments
of the happiest and best minds,&quot; and it is time that the
working men and women of England were made partakers in this inheritance
of wealth and joy.<BR>
<BR>
It maybe argued that it should be the aim of our schools and universities
to educate the working classes to appreciate what is best in standard
English poetry. I do not deny that much maybe done in this way,
but let<BR>
us not forget that something more will be needed than a course
of instruction in poetic diction and metrical rhythm. Our great
poets depict a world which is only to a very small extent that
of the working man. It is a world of courts and drawingrooms and
General Headquarters, a world of clubs and academies. The working
man or woman finds a place in this charmed world only if his occupation
is that of a shepherd, and even then he must be a shepherd of
the Golden Age and answer to the name of Corydon. Poets, we are
solemnly assured by Pope, must not describe shepherds as they
really are, &quot;but as they may be conceived to have been when
the best of men followed the employment of shepherd.&quot;&nbsp;
Class-consciousness - a word often on the lips of our democratic
leaders of today - has held far too much sway over the minds of
poets from the Elizabethan age onwards. Spenser writes his 'Faerie
Queene' &quot;to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous
and gentle discipline,&quot; and Milton's audience, fit but few,
is composed of scholars whose ears have been attuned to the harmonies
of epic verse from their first lisping of Virgilian hexameters,
or of latter-day Puritans, like John Bright, who overhear in 'Paradise
Lost' the echoes of a faith that once was stalwart.<BR>
<BR>
But what, it may be asked, of Crabbe, and what of Wordsworth?
confession, paints&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
the cot,&nbsp;<BR>
As truth will paint it and as bards will not;&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
but as we listen to his verse tales we can never forget that it
is the Rev. George Crabbe who is instructing us, or that his pedestal
is the topmost story of his three-decker pulpit at Aldborough.
Wordsworth's sympathy with the lives of the Cumberland peasantry
is profound, and the time is surely not distant when such a poem
as 'Michael' will win a place in the hearts of working men; but
it is to be feared that in his own generation &quot;Mr Wudsworth&quot;
served rather - as a warning than an encouragement to his peasant
neighbours. &quot;Many's the time,&quot; an old<BR>
Cumberland innkeeper told Canon Rawnsley, &quot;I've seed him
a-takin' his family out in a string, and niver geein' the deariest
bit of notice to 'em; standin' by hissel' an' stoppin' behind
a-gapin', wi' his jaws workin' the whoal time; but niver no crackin'
wi' 'em, nor no pleasure in 'em - a desolate-minded man, ye kna...
It was potry as did it.&quot;(2)<BR>
<BR>
Our English non-dramatic poetry from the Renaissance onwards is
second to none in richness of thought and beauty of diction, but
it lacks the&nbsp; highest quality of all - universality of interest
and appeal. Our poets have turned a cold shoulder to the activities
and aims of the working man, and the working man has, in consequence,
turned a cold shoulder to the great English classic poets. The
loss on either side has been great, though it is only now beginning
to be realised. &quot;A literature which leaves large areas of
the national activity and aspiration unexpressed is in danger
of becoming narrow, esoteric, unhealthy. Areas of activity and
aspiration unlit by the cleansing sun of art, untended by the
loving consideration of the poet, will be dungeons for the national
spirit, mildewed cellars in which rats fight, misers hoard their
gold, and Guy Fawkes lays his train to blow the superstructure
sky-high.&quot;(3)<BR>
<BR>
There was a time when poetry meant much more to the working men
of England. In the later Middle Ages, above all in that fifteenth
century which literary historians are fond of describing as the
darkest period in English literature, the working man had won
for himself what seemed a secure place in poetry. Narrative, lyric
and dramatic poetry had all opened their portals to him, and made
his life and aims their theme. Side by side with the courtly verse
romances, which were read in the bowers of highborn ladies, were
the terse and popular ballads, which were chanted by minstrels,
wandering from town to town and from village to village. Among
the heroes of these ballads we find that &quot;wight yeoman,&quot;
Robin Hood, who wages war against mediaeval capitalism, as embodied
in the persons of the abbot-landholders, and against the class
legislation of Norman game laws which is enforced by the King's
sheriff. The lyric poetry of the century is not the courtly Troubadour
song or the Petrarchian sonnet, but the folk-song that sings from
the heart to the heart of the beauty of Alysoun, &quot;seemliest
of all things,&quot; or, in more convivial mood, accounts good
ale of more worth than a table set with many dishes:<BR>
<BR>
Bring us in no capon's flesh, for that is often dear,<BR>
Nor bring us in no duck's flesh, for they slobber in the mere,<BR>
But bring us in good ale!&nbsp;<BR>
Bring us in good ale, and bring us in good ale;<BR>
For our blessed Lady sake bring us in good ale.<BR>
<BR>
Most remarkable of all is the history of the drama in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries. The drama was clerical and not popular
in its origin, and when, in course of time, it passed out of the
hands of the clergy it is natural to suppose that it would find
a new home at the King's court or the baron's castle. It did nothing
of the kind. It passed from the Church to the people, and it was
the artisan craftsmen of the English towns, organised in their
trade-guilds, to whom we owe the great cycles of our miracle plays.
The authors of these plays were restricted to Bible story for
their themes, but the popular character of their work is everywhere
apparent in the manner in which the material is handled and the
characters conceived. The Noah of the Deluge plays is an English
master joiner with a shrewish wife, and three sons who are his
apprentices. When the divine command to build an ark comes to
him, he sets to work with an energy that drives away &quot;the
weariness of five hundred winters&quot; and, &quot;ligging on
his line,&quot; measures his planks, &quot;clenches them with
noble new nails&quot;, and takes a craftsman's delight in the
finished work:<BR>
<BR>
This work I warant both good and true.(4)<BR>
<BR>
In like manner, the Shepherds of the Nativity plays are conceived
and&nbsp; fashioned by men who, fortunate in that they knew nothing
of the seductions of Arcadian pastoralism, have studied at first
hand the habits and thoughts of English fifteenth-century shepherds,
and paint these to the life.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, at the close of the Middle Ages, narrative, lyric and dramatic
poetry seemed firmly established among the people. Not unmindful
of romance, it was grounded in realism and sought to interpret
the life of&nbsp; the peasant and the artisan of fifteenth-century
England. The Renaissance follows, and a profound change comes
over poetry. The popular note grows fainter and fainter, till
at last it becomes inaudible. Poetry leaves the farmyard and the
craftsman's bench for the court. The folk-song, fashioned in to
a thing of wondrous beauty by the creator of Amiens, Feste and
Autolycus, is driven from the stage by Ben Jonson, and its place
is taken by a lyric of classic extraction. The popular drama,
ennobled and made shapely through contact with Latin drama, passes
from the provincial market-place to Bankside, and the rude mechanicals
of the trade-guilds yield place to the Lord Chamberlain's players.
In the dramas of Shakespeare the popular note is still audible,
but only as an undertone, furnishing comic relief to the romantic
amours of courtly lovers or the tragic fall of Princes; with Beaumont
and Fletcher, and still more with Dryden and the Restoration dramatists,
the popular element in the drama passes away, and the triumph
of the court is complete. The Elizabethan court could find no
use for the popular ballad, but, like other forms of literature,
it was attracted from the country-side to the city. Forgetful
of the greenwood, it now battened on the garbage of Newgate, and
'Robin Hood and Guy of Gisburn' yields place to 'The Wofull Lamentation
of William Purchas, who for murthering his Mother at Thaxted,
was executed at Chelmsford'.<BR>
<BR>
We are justly proud of the Renaissance and of the glories of our
Elizabethan literature, but let us frankly own that in the annals
of poetry there was loss as well as gain. The gain was for the
courtier and the scholar, and for all those who, in the centuries
that followed the Renaissance, have been able, by means of education,
to enter into the<BR>
courtier's and scholar's inheritance. The loss has been for the
people.&nbsp; The opposition between courtly taste and popular
taste is hard to analyse, but we have only to turn our eyes from
England to Scotland, which lost its<BR>
royal court in 1603, in order to appreciate the reality of the
opposition. In Scotland the courtly poetry of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries soon disappeared when James I exchanged Holyrood
for Whitehall, but popular poetry continued to live and grow.
The folk-song gathered power and sweetness all through the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, till it culminated at last in the lyric
of Burns. Popular drama, never firmly rooted in Scotland, was
stamped out by the Reformation, but the popular ballad outlived
the mediaeval minstrel, was kept alive in the<BR>
homes of Lowland farmers and shepherds, and called into being
the great ballad revival of the nineteenth century.<BR>
<BR>
It is idle to speculate what would have been the progress of poetry
in England if the Renaissance had not come and the Elizabethan
courtier had not enriched himself at the expense of the people.
What we have to bear in mind is that all through the centuries
that followed the Renaissance the working men and women of England
looked almost in vain to their poets for a faithful interpretation
of their life and aims. The wonder is that the instinct for poetry
did not perish in their hearts for lack of sustenance.<BR>
<BR>
There are at the present time clear signs of a revival of popular
poetry and popular drama. The verse tales of Masefield and Gibson,
the lyrics of Patrick MacGill, the peasant or artisan plays which
have been produced at<BR>
the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, and the Gaiety Theatre, Manchester,
may well be the beginning of a great democratic literary movement.
Democracy, in its striving after a richer and fuller life for
the people of England, is at last turning its attention to literature
and art. It is slowly realising two great truths. The first is
that literature may be used as a mighty weapon in the furtherance
of political justice and social reform, and that the pied pipers
of folk-song have the power to rouse the nation and charm the
ears of even the Mother of Parliaments. The second is that the
working man needs something more to sustain him than bread and
the franchise and a fair day's wage for a fair day's work. Democracy,
having obtained for the working man a place in the government
of the nation, is now asserting his claim to a place in the temples
of poetry. The Arthurian knight, the Renaissance courtier, the
scholar and the wit must admit the twentieth-century artisan to
their circle. Piers the ploughman must once more become the hero
of song, and Saul Kane, the poacher, must find a place, alongside
of Tiresias and Merlin, among the seers and mystics. Let democracy
look to William Morris, poet, artist and social democrat, for
inspiration and guidance, and take to heart the message of prophecy
which he has left us: &quot;If art, which is now sick, is to live
and not die, it must in the future be of the people, for the people,&nbsp;
by the people.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the creation of this poetry &quot;of the people, by the people&quot;
dialect may well be called upon to play a part. Dialect is of
the people, though in a varying degree in the different parts
of the wide areas of the globe where<BR>
the English language is spoken; it possesses, moreover, qualities,
and is fraught with associations, which are of the utmost value
to the poet and to which the standard speech can lay no claim.
It may be that for some of the more elaborate kinds of poetry,
such as the formal epic, dialect is useless; let it be reserved,
therefore, for those kinds which appeal most directly to the hearts
of the people. The poetry of the people includes the ballad and
the verse tale, lyric in all its forms, and some kinds of satire;
and for all these dialect is a fitting instrument. It possesses<BR>
in the highest degree directness of utterance and racy vigour.
How much of their force would the &quot;Biglow Papers&quot; of
J. R. Lowell lose if they were transcribed from the Yankee dialect
into standard English!<BR>
<BR>
But the highest quality of dialect speech, and that which renders
it pre-eminently fitted for poetic use, is its intimate association
with all that lies nearest to the heart of the working man. It
is the language of his hearth and home; many of the most cherished
memories of his life are bound up with it; it is for him the language
of freedom, whereas standard English is that of constraint. In
other words, dialect is the working man's poetic diction - a poetic
diction as full of savour as that of the eighteenth-century poets
was flat and insipid.<BR>
<BR>
It is sometimes said that the use of dialect makes the appeal
of poetry provincial instead of national or universal. This is
only true when the dialect poet is a pedant and obscures his meaning
by fantastic spellings.&nbsp; The Lowland Scots element in 'Auld
Lang Syne' has not prevented it from becoming the song of friendship
of the Anglo-Saxon race all the world over. Moreover, the provincial
note in poetry or prose is far from being a bad thing. In the
'Idylls' of Theocritus it gave new life to Greek poetry in the
third century before Christ, and it may render the same high service
to English poetry to-day or to-morow. The rise of Provincial schools
of literature, interpreting local life in local idiom, in all
parts of the British Isles and in the Britain beyond the seas,
is a goal worth striving for; such a literature, so far from impeding
the progress of the literature in the standard tongue, would serve
only to enrich it in spirit, substance and form.<BR>

A Yorkshire Proverb.<BR>
<BR>
It's hard when fowks can't finnd their wark<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheer they've bin bred an' born;<BR>
When I were young I awlus thowt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd bide 'mong t' roots an' corn.<BR>
But I've bin forced to work i' towns,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here's my litany:<BR>
Frae Hull, an' Halifax, an' Hell,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gooid Lord, deliver me!<BR>
<BR>
When I were courtin' Mary Ann,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T' owd squire, he says one day:<BR>
&quot;I've got no bield(1) for wedded fowks;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose, wilt ta wed or stay?&quot;<BR>
I couldn't gie up t' lass I loved,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To t' town we had to flee:<BR>
Frae Hull, an' Halifax, an' Hell,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gooid Lord, deliver me!<BR>
<BR>
I've wrowt i' Leeds an' Huthersfel',<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An' addled(2) honest brass;<BR>
I' Bradforth, Keighley, Rotherham,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've kept my barns an' lass.<BR>
I've travelled all three Ridin's round,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And once I went to sea:<BR>
Frae forges, mills, an' coalin' boats,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gooid Lord, deliver me!<BR>
<BR>
I've walked at neet through Sheffield loans,(3)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'T were same as bein' i' Hell:<BR>
Furnaces thrast out tongues o' fire,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An' roared like t' wind on t' fell.<BR>
I've sammed up coals i' Barnsley pits,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wi' muck up to my knee:<BR>
Frae Sheffield, Barnsley, Rotherham,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gooid Lord, deliver me!<BR>
<BR>
I've seen grey fog creep ower Leeds Brig<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As thick as bastile(4) soup;<BR>
I've lived wheer fowks were stowed away<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like rabbits in a coop.<BR>
I've watched snow float down Bradforth Beck<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As black as ebiny:<BR>
Frae Hunslet, Holbeck, Wibsey Slack,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gooid Lord, deliver me!<BR>
<BR>
But now, when all wer childer's fligged,(5)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To t' coontry we've coom back.<BR>
There's fotty mile o' heathery moor<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twix' us an' t' coal-pit slack.<BR>
And when I sit ower t' fire at neet,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I laugh an' shout wi' glee:&nbsp;<BR>
Frae Bradforth, Leeds, an Huthersfel',&nbsp;<BR>
Frae Hull, an' Halifax, an' Hell,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T' gooid Lord's delivered me!<BR>

The Roman remains found at Slack were a marching camp.<BR>

Pale their faces, proud their bearin',&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an' a strange gloor i' their een,<BR>
As they marched past an' saluted,&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while th' east wind blew snell an' keen.<BR>

Dalewards, dalewards, iver dalewards,&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; th' hill-fowk wander yeer by yeer,<BR>

custom to tell the bees when a death had taken place in the<BR>
family. The hive had to be put into mourning, and when<BR>
the arval, or funeral feast, was held, after the return<BR>
from the grave, small portions of everything eaten or&nbsp;<BR>
drunk had to be given to the bees in a saucer. Failure&nbsp;<BR>
to do this meant either the death or departure of the bees.<BR>

Whisht! laatle bees, sad tidings I bear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bees, bees, murmurin' low ;<BR>
Cauld i' his grave ligs your maister dear,<BR>

Nea mair he'll fettle his sickle for t' corn.&nbsp;<BR>
Nea mair he'll coom to your skep of a morn,<BR>

<P><A NAME="THE FLOWER OF WENSLEYDALE"></A><FONT SIZE="+2">The
Flower of Wensleydale<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>
She leaned o'er her latticed casement,<BR>
The Flower of Wensleydale;<BR>
'Twas St Agnes Eve at midnight,<BR>
Through the mist the stars burnt pale.<BR>
<BR>
In her hand she held twelve sage-leaves,<BR>
Plucked in her garden at noon;<BR>
And over them she had whispered thrice<BR>
The spell of a mystic rune.<BR>
<BR>
For many had come a-wooing<BR>
The maid with the sloe-blue eyes;<BR>
Fain would she learn of St Agnes<BR>
To whom should fall the prize.<BR>
<BR>
They said she must drop a sage-leaf<BR>
At each stroke of the midnight hour;&nbsp;<BR>
Then should the knight of her father's choice&nbsp;<BR>
Obey the summons of her voice,<BR>
And appear 'neath her oriel'd bowwer.<BR>
<BR>
To the holy virgin-martyr<BR>
She lifted her hands in prayer;<BR>
Then she watched the rooks that perched asleep<BR>
In the chestnut branches bare.<BR>
<BR>
At last on the frosty silence<BR>
There rang out the midnight chime;<BR>
And the hills gave back in echoes<BR>
The knell of the dying time.<BR>
<BR>
She held her breath as she counted<BR>
The beats of the chapel bell;<BR>
At every stroke of the hammer<BR>
A sage-leaf fluttered and fell,<BR>
Slowly fluttered and fell.<BR>
<BR>
Her heart stood still a moment,<BR>
As the last leaf touched the ground;<BR>
And her hand went swift to her maiden breast,<BR>
For she heard a far-off sound;<BR>
<BR>
'Twas the sound of a horseman spurring<BR>
His steed through the woodland glade;&nbsp;<BR>
And ever the sound drew nearer,&nbsp;<BR>
And the footfalls echoed clearer,&nbsp;<BR>
Till before her bower they stayed.<BR>
<BR>
She strained her eyes to discover,<BR>
By the light of a ghostly moon,<BR>
Who was the knight had heard and obeyed<BR>
The hest of the mystic rune.<BR>
<BR>
But naught could she see from her casement,<BR>
Save a man on a coal-black steed;<BR>
For his mantle was muffled about him,<BR>
His blazon she could not read.<BR>
<BR>
She crossed herself and she whispered -<BR>
Her voice was faint but clear -<BR>
&quot;Oh! Who art thou that darest ride,&nbsp;<BR>
Through the aspen glade, by the river's side,<BR>
My chamber window near?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Say, art thou the lord of Bainbridge,<BR>
Or Gervase of Bolton Hall,<BR>
That comest so late on St Agnes Eve<BR>
Within my manor wall?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I am not the lord of Bainbridge,<BR>
Nor Gervase of Bolton Hall,<BR>
But I marked the light in thy casement,<BR>
And I saw the sage-leaves fall,<BR>
Flutter awhile and fall.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Camest thou over the moorlands,<BR>
Or camest thou through the dale?<BR>
Speak no guile to a witless maid,<BR>
But tell me a soothfast tale.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I came not over the moorlands,<BR>
Nor along the dale did ride;<BR>
But thou seeest thy plighted lover,<BR>
That has come to claim his bride.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Say, art thou knight or yeoman,<BR>
Of noble or simple birth?<BR>
Fain would I know thy lineage,<BR>
Thy prowess and thy worth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nor knight nor lowly yeoman,<BR>
But a mighty king am I;<BR>
Bold vassals do my bidding,<BR>
And on mine errands hie.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They come to court and castle,<BR>
They climb the palace stairs;<BR>
Nor pope nor king may entrance bar<BR>
To him my livery wears.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But why should a king so mighty<BR>
Pay court to a simple maid?<BR>
My father's a knight of low degree,&nbsp;<BR>
No princely realm he holds in fee,&nbsp;<BR>
No proud-foot damsels wait on me:<BR>
Thy steps have surely strayed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No step of mine hath wandered<BR>
From the goal of my desires;<BR>
'Tis on thee my hopes are centred,<BR>
'Tis to thee my heart aspires.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I love thee for thy beauty,<BR>
I love thee for thy grace,<BR>
I love thee for the dancing lights<BR>
That gleam in thy moon-lit face:<BR>
And these I deem a peerless dower<BR>
To win a king's embrace.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;One boon, O royal lover,<BR>
I ask on St Agnes Day;<BR>
I fain would gaze on thy visage fair<BR>
Ere with thee I steal away.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Unmuffle thou the mantle<BR>
That hides thee like a pall;<BR>
And let the purple trappings<BR>
From off thy shoulders fall.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Slowly he loosed the mantle,<BR>
And showed his face beneath.&nbsp;<BR>
The lights went out in the maiden's eyes;&nbsp;<BR>
One swooning word she breathed to the skies:<BR>
The gaunt hills echoed &quot;Death.&quot;</FONT></P>
