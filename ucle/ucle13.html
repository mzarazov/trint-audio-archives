      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left">Theatrical tradition
      holds that uttering the word &quot;Macbeth&quot; anywhere inside
      a playhouse other than on the stage will bring dire misfortune
      on all within earshot. There are also some bizarre remedies,
      which include spinning around and shouting quotations from the
      Bard. History tells us that Macbeth was a Scottish king from
      1040 to 1057, and ascended the throne upon the death of his uncle,
      Duncan. Shakespeare wove these facts into a supernatural murder
      story where Macbeth suffers a violent death (but this is not
      uncommon in the Bard's canon), and the play itself does not contain
      a grounding reference to why it would be unlucky.</P>

      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left">Theatrical folklore
      has it that the &quot;cure&quot; for saying &quot;Macbeth&quot;
      inside of a playhouse is to step outside of the playhouse, turn
      three times uttering a profanity, and then requesting permission
      to return to the premises.

      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left">&quot;He met his
      Waterloo&quot;. This refers to the defeat of Napoleon in 1815
      by the Allied forces led by Wellington. Many historians agree
      that the battle was lost due to a compounding of numerous tactical
      errors.</P>

      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left">The battle began
      at 11:00 AM with a diversionary assault on the Chateau of Hougomont,
      which was successfully held by the Cold Stream Guards. Enraged,
      Jerome Bonaparte ordered more and more forces committed to the
      chateau until his entire corps was involved, or roughly 25% of
      Napoleon's infantry. When the infantry was needed for the full
      assault, Jerome's corps was depleted and unable to assist.</P>

      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left">Roughly an hour
      after the assault on Hougomont was mounted, the second corps
      was sent forward to crush Wellington's left flank. This should
      have been an easy task, as Wellington had little defences on
      his left flank. For reasons that still remain shrouded in mystery,
      the advancing French column was ordered to execute a strange
      flanking maneuver, which enabled the Inniskilling Regiment to
      deliver a devastating enfilade. The French advance was routed,
      and they ran headlong from the field with the Scots Greys Cavalry
      in hot pursuit. The remainder of the battle is filled with similar
      such disasterous tactics.</P>

      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left">&quot;Waterloo&quot;
      is used in English to signify a devastating and utter defeat.</P>

      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left">Wellington's citations
      following the battle &quot;It was a near run thing&quot;, and
      &quot;By God, I don't think we would have done it if I wasn't
      here&quot; have also enjoyed popularity.</P>

      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left">As an interesting
      side-note, after Napoleon quit the field, his &quot;Old Guard&quot;
      formed a battle square to cover his retreat. Two French soldiers
      who rallied in the much-revered &quot;Last Square of the Old
      Guard&quot; are notable to English language lovers. The first
      was (reportedly) Nicolas Chauvin, whose name later appears in
      our language as &quot;chauvinist&quot;. The other was Brigadier
      General Cambronne (later immortalised by Victor Hugo), who bequethed
      what is called &quot;le mot a Cambronne&quot;, a catch-word of
      glorious defiance against insurmountable odds (cf &quot;nuts&quot;).</P>

      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left">And of course &quot;Old
      Guard&quot; is used in English to refer to a &quot;group of established
      prestige and influence.&quot;</P>

      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left">As a literary figure
      in his own right, Napoleon has appeared in works by Coleridge,
      Southey, Landor, Wordsworth, Scott, Byron, and Hazlitt.</P>

      <P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left">And finally, while
      some etymologists have hinted that &quot;Waterloo&quot; is the
      source of the English word &quot;loo&quot; (&quot;water closet&quot;
      becoming &quot;Waterloo&quot; becoming &quot;loo&quot;), such
      theories have not gained acceptance.
