      <P>Confirmed: Mr. Doyley (whose first name, sadly, is unknown)
      ran a drapery shop on the Strand &quot;a little West of Catherine
      Street&quot; during the reign of Queen Anne. By the 17th century,
      his name appeared in &quot;doily-napkin&quot;, and ultimately
      &quot;doily&quot;.</P>

      <P>Confirmed: Edward Lloyd ran a popular coffeehouse on Tower
      Street in the late 17th century. The insurance underwriters who
      gathered there to conduct business later formed a consortium
      and named it &quot;Lloyd's of London&quot; in honour of this
      coffeehouse.</P>

      <P>Confirmed: George &quot;Beau&quot; Brummell's grandfather,
      William Brummell, ran a lodging house on Bury Street. &quot;Beau
      Brummell&quot; can be used to describe a dandy, fop, or arrogant
      socialite. The adjective &quot;Brummellian&quot; appears in the
      OED2.</P>

      <P>Confirmed: Dick Whittington, who was a London milner, left
      us the term &quot;Whittington chimes&quot;.</P>

      <P>Arguable: While not a merchant, bailiff Joseph Dun was frequently
      employed by 16th century London merchants to collect bad debts.
      By the 17th century, his name was being used as a verb meaning
      to collect an amount owed.</P>

      <P>Arguable: The last proper job Cesar Ritz held before opening
      his own establishment was at the Hotel Savoy on the Strand. His
      first &quot;shop&quot;, however, was in Paris.</P>

      <P>Doubtful: A story goes that Davy Jones ran a 16th century
      London pub and was engaged in the practice of &quot;Shanghai&quot;.
      His &quot;locker&quot; was used to transport his captives to
      the waiting ships. Contributor Phil adds: &quot;...Partridge
      suggests that Davy Jones (and variants), meaning the spirit of
      the sea, appeared ca1750. He quotes Weekley's suggestion that
      it is a corruption of Jonah, with Davy added by Welsh sailors...&quot;</P>

      <P>Disqualified: Tradition has it that the phrase &quot;mad as
      a hatter&quot; first referred to a wealthy London hatter, Robert
      Crab, who ran a hat shop near Cambridge Circus. Afflicted by
      prolonged exposure to mercury, he became psychotic. &quot;Mad
      as a hatter&quot; does not contain an eponym.</P>

      <P>Disqualified: Thomas Crapper ran a plumbing firm at 120 King's
      Road. Even though he may have helped popularize the &quot;water
      closet&quot;, flush toilets appeared in London at least fifty
      years before his birth. The word &quot;crap&quot; comes from
      the Dutch &quot;krappe&quot; and entered the English language
      in the 15th century.

  <TR>
    <TD WIDTH="100%">
      <P>&quot;Cripplegate&quot; may have taken its name from cripples
      who frequented the area, but a more plausible explanation is
      that it comes from &quot;Crepel&quot;, which meant &quot;a low
      arch&quot; or &quot;a covered passageway&quot;. Tradition has
      it that the corruption of the name became complete when reports
      of miracle cures (associated with King Edmund) in the area began
      to circulate.</P>

      <P>The &quot;Crutched&quot; in &quot;Crutched Friars&quot; refers
      to the cross (as in &quot;crux&quot;) worn by the Friars of the
      Holy Cross, who had a house in the area.</P>

      <P>Phil comments: &quot;I have read that the name comes from
      the ME &quot;crouch&quot; meaning a cross, rather than from the
      Latin. The Imperial Dictonary of 1850 describes the order as
      &quot;Crouched-Friars&quot;. It also includes a then extant verb
      &quot;to crouch&quot; meaning to bless or sign with the cross
      which seems to have existed completely independently of the sense
      &quot;to bend&quot;. Similarly the &quot;crouchback&quot; nickname
      of Richard III may refer to having a cross emblazoned on his
      back rather than a deformity. &quot;Cross&quot; (from the same
      origin) was evidently imported by Irish monks and replaced &quot;crouch&quot;
      for some reason.&quot;

      <P>A &quot;bob&quot; was one shilling. Although the currency
      unit was lost in 1971, the phrase, &quot;that will cost you a
      few bob&quot; is still used. Some of the slang for the 10s coin
      was transfered to 50p coin, as in &quot;cows&quot;. Other slang
      terms are listed in the table below.</P>
