Once there was a young rat named Arthur, who could never make up his
mind.
 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them,
he would
 only answer, "I don't know." He wouldn't say "yes" or "no" either.
He would
 always shirk making a choice.

       <P>His aunt Helen said to him, "Now look here. No one is going to care
for you if
 you carry on like this. You have no more mind than a blade of grass."

       <P>One rainy day, the rats heard a great noise in the loft. The pine rafters
were all
 rotten, so that the barn was rather unsafe. At last the joists gave
way and fell
 to the ground. The walls shook and all the rats' hair stood on end
with fear and
 horror. "This won't do," said the captain. "I'll send out scouts to
search for a
 new home."

       <P>Within five hours the ten scouts came back and said, "We found a stone
house
 where there is room and board for us all. There is a kindly horse named
Nelly,
 a cow, a calf, and a garden with an elm tree." The rats crawled out
of their little
 houses and stood on the floor in a long line. Just then the old one
saw Arthur.
 "Stop," he ordered coarsely. "You are coming, of course?" "I'm not
certain," said
 Arthur, undaunted. "The roof may not come down yet." "Well," said the
angry
 old rat, "we can't wait for you to join us. Right about face. March!"

       <P>Arthur stood and watched them hurry away. "I think I'll go tomorrow,"
he calmly
 said to himself, but then again "I don't know; it's so nice and snug
here."

       <P>That night there was a big crash. In the morning some men&#8212;with some
boys
 and girls&#8212;rode up and looked at the barn. One of them moved a board
and he
 saw a young rat, quite dead, half in and half out of his hole. Thus
the shirker got
 his due.
