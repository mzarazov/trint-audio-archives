       <p>[Added note, 28 November 2000: I realize that the author of the subject reformed spelling
scheme has probably continued to work on it, so that many of my comments on it may no longer be applicable to
the scheme as it now stands.]
       <p>
Here are some comments on <a href="http://reformedorthography.cjb.net">A Reformed Orthography for the English Language</a>. I will use the following abbreviations:</p>

       
        
       <table align="center" width="80%">
        <tr valign="top">
         <td>AE&nbsp;-</td><td>American English</td>
        <tr valign="top">
         <td>BC&nbsp;-</td><td>My idiolect</td>
        <tr valign="top">
								 <td>BE&nbsp;-</td><td>the modern received pronunciation used in <i>The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</i> (NSOED)</td>
        <tr valign="top">
         <td>CO&nbsp;-</td><td>conventional orthography</td>
        <tr valign="top">
         <td>RO&nbsp;-</td><td>the proposed reformed orthography</td>
        <tr valign="top">
         <td>RP&nbsp;-</td><td>the traditional received pronunciation that is used in <i>The Concise Oxford Dictionary</i>, Eighth Edition.</td>
       </table>
       <p>Pronunciations shown within vertical bars are in the notation of Evan Kirshenbaum's ASCII
IPA.  I've used vertical bars instead of square brackets or slashes
because I think the distinction between phonetics and phonemics is
irrelevant to a discussion of this sort.  I've converted
pronunciations copied and pasted from NSOED from the NSOED scheme to
ASCII IPA.
</p>
       <p>
The fallacy of trying to devise a reformed orthography that will
please everyone is at least twofold.  One aspect is the greatly
different pronunciations that are used in different communities.  The
great number of such differences is typified by 'geyser' and
'Argentine' (|gaIz@r| and |ArdZ@nti:n| in AE, |gi:z@| and
|'A:dZ@ntVIn| in BE).  A great class of contrasting pronunciations
arises from the fact that some dialects are rhotic and some are
nonrhotic.
</p>
       <p>
A second aspect is the impossibility of finding vowel representations
that are likely to please everyone.  In the remainder of this posting,
I'll dwell mostly on that second aspect.
</p>
       Following are some specific examples of the failure of RO to devise
vowel symbols that consistently show the same pronunciation or that
are at all transportable from BE to AE:
       <p>
       <ul>
        <li>BE uses entirely different vowels in 'cat' and 'bath', but the
examples in RO show them to be the same.
         <p class="bq">
    CO: cat, bath<br>
    RO: cat, bath<br>
    BE: |kat|, |bA:T|<br>
    BC: |k&amp;t|, |b&amp;T|
</p>
        <li>BE uses an unrounded vowel in 'father', a rounded vowel in 'what'.  RO
shows the two to have the same vowel.
         <p class="bq">
CO: father, what<br>
RO: faadher, waat<br>
           
BE: |'fA:D@|, |wA.t|<br>
BC: |'fA:D@r|, |wA:t|
</p>
        <li>BE uses |O|, the rounded, back, close-mid vowel in certain words,
while AE has either that vowel or |A|, the unrounded, back, open
vowel.
         <p class="bq">
CO: call, walk, broad<br>
RO: koal, woak, broad   <br>
BE: |kO:l|, |wO:k|, |brO:d|<br>
BC: |kA:l|, |wA:k|, |brA:d|
</p>
        <li>RO has the same vowel in 'team' and the second vowel in 'happy', while
RP has different vowels.
         <p class="bq">
CO: team, happy<br>
RO: tym, hapy,   <br>
RP: |ti:m|, |h&amp;pI|
</p>
        <li>In many dialects, the second vowel in 'music' is the same as the vowel
in 'pick'.  In BC the second vowel in 'music' is the vowel of 'peek'.
         <p class="bq">
CO: pick, music<br>
RO: pik, myoozik <br>
BE: |pIk|, |mjusIk|<br>
BC: |pIk|, |mjusik|
</p>
        <li>BE uses a vowel, |A.|, in words like 'got', 'hot', and 'rock', while
that vowel may not even exist in AE and certainly does not exist in
BC.
         <p class="bq">
CO: got, rock<br>
RO: got, rok<br>
BE: |gA.t|, |rA.k|<br>
BC: |gA:t|, |rA:k|
</p>
        <li>It should strike BE speakers as quite strange to see a symbol
suggesting the |o| sound in words like 'go' and 'hoax'.  Their
diphthong in those words doesn't contain anything similar to an |o|
sound.  Rather it uses a schwa where AE uses |o|.
         <p class="bq">
CO: go, hoax<br>
RO: gow, howks<br>
BE: |g@U|, |h@Uks| <br>
BC: |goU|, |hoUks|
</p>
        <li>It might sound somewhat ludicrous to a BE speaker to hear 'stupid'
pronounced with plain |u| instead of |ju| ('oo' instead of 'yoo').  It
might have about the same effect as hearing 'music' pronounced |muzIk|
('moozic') would have on me.
         <p class="bq">
CO: rude, stupid<br>
RO: rood, stoopid<br>
BE: rude |ru:d|, stupid |'stju:pId| ('styoopid')<br>
BC: rude |ru:d|, stupid |'stu:p@d|
</p>
        <li>The diphthong in words like 'fly' and 'style' in BE has a schwa where
AE has |a|.  Also, I find it strange in BE to see the second vowel of
the diphthong represented as |I| (the vowel of 'pit').  I hear myself
using |i| (the vowel of 'peat').
         <p class="bq">
CO: fly, style<br>
RO: flai, stail<br>
BE: |flVI|, |stVIl|<br>
BC: |flai|, |stail|
</p>
       </ul>
       <p>Some additional comments, not related to pronunciation:
       <ul>
        <li>The flags shown at the top of the RO Web page represent the following
countries:
         <p class="bq">
England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Ireland, United States,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand
</p>
         <p>In contrast with that selection, which may be taken to be the author's
idea of the principal English-speaking communities, the 1995
<i>Britannica Yearbook</i> listed the following countries, in descending
order of number of speakers, as the ones that had 100,000 or more
mother-tongue speakers of English:
</p>
         <p class="bq">
United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, South Africa,
Ireland, New Zealand, Trinidad and Tobago, India, Zimbabwe,
Hong Kong, Belize, Malaysia, Spain<br>
          <br>

(For the numbers, see <a href="Distribution_English_speakers.shtml">Worldwide Distribution of English Speakers</a>)</p>
        <li>Typo noted in passing:
         <p class="bq">
    CO: the, this, weather<br>
    RO: dhe, dhis, weather 
</p>
       </ul>

       <p>The designer of the reformed-spelling scheme, Brian Nolfi, posted 
a rebuttal to my comments, and he has given me permission to install his remarks here:
