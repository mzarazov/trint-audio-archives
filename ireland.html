       <p>This is a footnote to John Davies's article &quot;<a href="english_british_uk_et_al.shtml">Britain/Great Britain/United Kingdom &amp;c: Some Common Confusions</a>&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<p>
Some confusion surrounds the question of what we should call the independent 
sovereign state that occupies 80% of the land area of the island of Ireland. 
That confusion is entirely understandable, and the purpose of this note is to 
remove it.</p>
       <p>
The <b>Irish Constitution</b> of 1937 says: "The name of the State is 
&Eacute;ire, or, in the English language,<b> Ireland</b>".</p>
       <p>
The <b>Republic of Ireland Act</b>, 1948, says: "It is hereby declared that the 
description of the State shall be  the <b>Republic of Ireland</b>."</p>
       <p>
Irish <b>passports</b> simply bear the name <b>Ireland</b>. </p>
       <p>
<b>Irish government</b> regulations and official statements frequently refer to 
"the <b>Republic of Ireland</b>".</p>
       <p>
<b>Comhairle</b>, a statutory agency responsible for the provision of 
information, advice and advocacy to members of the public on social service, 
says on its web site:
       <p class=bq>
'The names of political entities and other terms can often be quite 
contentious. The Irish and British governments have agreed to use the official 
names by which each state describes itself. (This agreement was made at the 
same time as the British-Irish Agreement). The correct name for this country is 
Ireland, not the "Republic of Ireland".'</p>
       <p>
First, a brief summary of the historical setting. The struggle for Irish 
independence attained only partial success in 1921 with the creation of the 
Irish Free  State. From a republican point of view it was deficient in two 
principal respects: Ireland  remained part of the British Commonwealth, with the 
British King as its titular head;  and the six counties of the north-eastern 
part of the island remained part of the United  Kingdom. A successful attempt 
was made in 1937 to distance the state from Britain with  a new constitution, 
removing all references to the British Crown, and renaming the state 
"&Eacute;ire, or, in the English language, Ireland". That constitution also laid 
claim to  sovereignty over Northern Ireland, a claim which remains to this day, 
though  significantly modified in the wake of the Good Friday Agreement between 
the Irish and  UK governments in 1998.</p>
       <p>
In 1948 the Irish government decided to sever all links with the British 
Commonwealth. The Republic of Ireland Act was its main legal instrument. 
The following quotes from contemporary parliamentary debates on the subject  are 
revealing: 
       <ol>
         
        <li>Major de Valera: &#8230;I say the name "&Eacute;ire" was misrepresented in 
  popular  usage and in some places it was maliciously used to designate the 
  Twenty-Six  Counties and not the Ireland of the Constitution. I want to appeal 
  to all Deputies  here to co-operate in securing that the usage of the words 
  "Republic of Ireland"  or "Poblacht na h&Eacute;ireann" will not degenerate into 
  merely a description of the  Twenty-Six Counties as a republic. </li>
        <li>Mr. Duffy: [With reference to the Constitution of 1937] &#8230;The question 
  whether this country was to be described as a republic or not was a matter for 
  decision outside the Constitution, a matter to be decided independently.</li>
        <li>The Taoiseach:  &#8230;If I say that my name is Costello and that my 
  description is that of senior counsel, I think that will be clear to anybody who 
  wants to know. If the Senator will look at Article 4 of the Constitution she 
  will  find that the name of the State is &Eacute;ire. Section 2 of this Bill 
  declares that "this  State shall be described as the Republic of Ireland". Its 
  name in Irish is &Eacute;ire and  in the English language Ireland. Its 
  description in the English language is "the  Republic of Ireland".</li>
       </ol>
       <p> 
The question of a possible conflict with the Constitution was pertinent, since a 
constitutional amendment would require a referendum which the government was not 
sure it could win. But in any case there was no good reason to change the 
Constitution  in this way, for the option to use "Ireland" as the name of the 
state could be useful  internationally, as the following extract from The Times 
of  8 August 1949 - just four  months after the Act came into force - makes 
clear:</p>
       <p class=bq>Mr MacBride, the Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs, tonight sent an official 
request to the Council of Europe  to refer to his country simply as Ireland and 
not as Eire or as the Republic of Ireland. This request is seen by observers 
here  as part of a systematic campaign by the Government in Dublin to link the 
question of the partition of Ireland with every organization of which it is a 
member.</p>
       <p> 
The Act was passed by a unanimous vote of both D&aacute;il and Senate, and came 
into force on Easter Monday, 18 April 1949, the anniversary of the 1916 Easter 
rising -  when those who seized the GPO had first proclaimed "Poblacht na 
h&Eacute;ireann". </p>
       <p> 
So is the Act, or that part of it concerning the "description", 
unconstitutional?  Only the Irish Supreme Court could rule that it is, and in 
over 50 years they have not  chosen to do so. It seems a safe bet that they are 
not likely to in future. The lawyerly  quibble made by Taoiseach John Costello 
about the distinction between the "name" of  the state and its "description" has 
stood the test of time.</p>
       <p> 
The conflict between the two terms can still be a live issue, and it has been 
said  that it led to arguments during the negotiations leading up to the Good 
Friday  Agreement. In the event the treaty between the two states names them as 
"Ireland" and  "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland", 
representing  modest  concessions by both sides.</p>
       <p> 
So whilst it is strictly true that "Ireland" is the name of the republic, that 
does  not  mean that one should avoid the use of the phrase "Republic of 
Ireland", which  frequently appears in directives, press releases and other 
official documents from the  Irish government, as a search of their official web 
site at <a href="http://www.irlgov.ie/">http://www.irlgov.ie/</a> will  readily 
show. </p>
       <p> 
The advice stands: in many contexts it is safe and uncontentious to refer to the 
Republic simply as "Ireland". Where the possibility of ambiguity exists, use 
"the  Republic of Ireland".
