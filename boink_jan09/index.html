              <p>A report on the 16 January 2009 Oxboink was posted 
                to the newsgroup by Laura and is reproduced here:</p>
              <p class="bq"> Mike L, Mike&rsquo;s friends Julia (the clich&eacute; expert) and Philip, Katy J and Laura met at Quod
                today, joined after the first course by Paul who was delayed by traffic jams. This boink was unusually focused
                and all discussion was strictly on topic so Your Correspondent was able to construct the following detailed
                minutes (although she may have omitted some stuff because she can't decipher her notes).</p>
              <p class="bq">Food: Mike and Laura opted for the poached salmon salad with couscous which was served somewhat oddly in
                kilner jars. Philip announced that he would drink any sort of wine which prompted a discussion of the appropriate
                word to describe him, which would be the equivalent of omnivorous. Omnibibulous and pansymposial were suggested.
                The wine list was sadly straightforward with none of the descriptive flights of fancy which on an earlier
                occasion this week prompted Laura to invent a game of &ldquo;If you were a wine on this list, which one would
                you be?&rdquo; However, the lack of menu material to analyse was somewhat remedied when Mike produced the
                wrapping from an electrical item he had recently purchased which carried an almost unintelligible translation
                from Japanese.</p>
              <p class="bq">Sheep: these were briefly mentioned when Paul told of his business dealings with the Falkland Islands.</p>
              <p class="bq">Laughter: there was much of this, which was then analysed, which led to more of it. It was noted that words
                describing things which make people laugh tended to have negative connotations, for example ridiculous and
                risible. Hilarific was suggested. Types of laugh were performed and considered in some detail. Mike was accused
                of guffawing (but if he did so it was very quiet as Your Correspondent didn&rsquo;t hear it). Katy provided
                illustrations of cackling and shrieking. Categories such as dirty laughs, laughs accompanied by body movement
                and army laughs were identified. No conclusions were reached so this item will be carried forward to a future
                boink agenda.</p>
              <p class="bq">Matters for report: 1. &ldquo;The Barber of Camarthen&rdquo; is an opera composed by a cousin
                of Vaughan Williams, whose first name is shrouded in mystery (the cousin, not Ralph pronounced Rafe) with
                a libretto by Nosier pronounced Nosher Thomas, a little-known cousin of Dylan, but no-one present could sing
                any of it. 2. Eithne is pronounced Enya. 3. Mike: (a) knew of an Yvonne pronounced Weaveney (b) is germinating
                hemp seeds in his airing cupboard (but don&rsquo;t tell anyone)</p>
              <p class="bq">Any other business: 1. Philip enquired if there was an aue motto and suggested &ldquo;But I digress&rdquo;,
                pace Tom Lehrer. 2. Remembrance of boinks past: those at the Tate and the British Museum were remembered,
                as was dear Graeme. We hoped that Stephanie&rsquo;s house move went well. 3. The recent torrent of excellent
                Tom Swifties was applauded. </p>
