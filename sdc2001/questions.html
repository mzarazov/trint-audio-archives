'My friends and I were smoking marijuana in a bar one day when an<BR>

particular soccer team. He was accompanied [I've assumed that the tosser<BR>

would have sex with anybody who bought her a tequila and a packet of<BR>
peanuts. The barman told the man that he had done something wrong; the<BR>
woman addressed the barman in a loud, aggressive and impertinent manner. <BR>

SHAGREEN, s. This English word, --French chagrin; Ital. zigrino; Mid.<BR>
High Ger. Zager,--comes from the Pers. saghri:, Turk. sa:ghri:, meaning<BR>
properly the croupe or quarter of a horse, from which the peculiar<BR>
granulated leather, also called sa:ghri: in the East, was originally<BR>
made. Diez considers the French (and English adopted) chagrin in the<BR>
sense of vexation to be the same word, as certain hard skins prepared in<BR>
this way were used as files, and hence the word is used figuratively for<BR>
gnawing vexation, as (he states) the Ital. lima also is (Etym.<BR>
Worterbuch, ed. 1861, ii. 240). He might have added the figurative<BR>
origin of tribulation. [This view is accepted by the N.E.D.; but Prof.<BR>
Skeat (Concise Dict.) denies its correctness.]
