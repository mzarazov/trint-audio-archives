       <p><i>DISCLAIMER: This description is confined to legal and other factual
 issues which seem to be capable of &quot;correct&quot; answers. It does not deal
 with psychological questions about &quot;Englishness&quot;, &quot;Britishness&quot; etc.,
 nor with issues of race. The question of whether there is an English
 or a British race (or both) and if so how this should be defined is
 just not a sensible question.</i></p>
       <h2>Preliminary: States and Nations</h2>
       <p>The British Isles are divided between two countries which are
 independent states in international law, namely 1) the United Kingdom
 of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (so called since 1927) and 2)
 the Republic of Ireland. Unlike the states of the USA or Germany, or
 the provinces of Canada, the constituent parts of the UK (England,
 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) do not have legislatures with
 their own areas of exclusive jurisdiction, and England has no
 legislature at all.</p>
       <p>It is not possible to have a federation without a constitution
 prescribing the powers of the different levels of government, and the
 UK has no such instrument. The primary principle of our constitutional
 law is that the UK Parliament can do anything. The legislation which
 created the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland
 Assemblies carefully reserved power to the UK Parliament to legislate
 in <i>all</i> matters. The powers of the subordinate legislatures are
 <i>devolved</i> powers. So the UK is not a federation; it is a unitary
 state.</p>
       <p>England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland have all been regarded for
 centuries as nations, and are still correctly referred to as such.
 This has nothing to do with legal status. England, Scotland and
 Ireland all were once Kingdoms, but no longer are (since 1707 in the
 case of England and Scotland, 1800 in the case of Ireland). Wales was
 not a Kingdom but a Principality, and is sometimes still referred to
 as such.</p>
       <h2>Concentric Circles</h2>
       <p>If, like me, you live in England, you are part of all of the following
 entities (listed in order of increasing size):</p>
       <ol>
        <li><a href="#e">England</a></li>
        <li><a href="#ew">England and Wales</a></li>
        <li><a href="#gb">Great Britain</a></li>
        <li><a href="#uk">The United Kingdom</a></li>
        <li><a href="#ukki">The United Kingdom and Islands</a></li>
        <li><a href="#bi">The British Isles</a></li>
        <li><a href="#cta">The Common Travel Area</a></li>
        <li><a href="#etuk">The European Territories of the United Kingdom</a></li>
        <li><a href="#eu">The European Union</a></li>
        <li><a href="#ukc">The United Kingdom and Colonies</a></li>
        <li><a href="#c">The Commonwealth</a></li>
       </ol>
       <h3><a name="e"></a>1. England</h3>
       <p>There is surprisingly little to say about England, except that it
 contains about 80% of the population of the UK and hence is
 overwhelmingly dominant in relation to all UK-wide political issues.
 It is an important administrative unit, and many UK government
 departments (such as the Department of Health) have jurisdiction only
 in England.</p>
       <h3><a name="ew"></a>2. England and Wales</h3>
       <p>This unit, which doesn't even have its own name, is important because
 it defines the jurisdiction of the English courts, usually just called
 &quot;the jurisdiction&quot; in legal terminology. It is the area of application
 of English law (which strictly should be called the law of England and
 Wales, but rarely is). There is no such thing as British or United
 Kingdom law, because there are no British or United Kingdom courts.
 Many statutes apply to the whole of the UK, but courts in Scotland or
 Northern Ireland may (and frequently do) interpret them differently
 from the English courts. This is why the Lockerbie trial took place in
 a Scottish court. Many administrative bodies have jurisdiction over
 England and Wales. The rule that the word &quot;England&quot; in a statute
 includes Wales was introduced by the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 and
 abolished by the Welsh Language Act 1967.</p>
       <h3><a name="gb"></a>3. Great Britain</h3>
       <p>This is a both a geographical term referring to the island on which
 the greater parts of England, Wales and Scotland are situated, and a
 legal one referring to those three territories considered together.
 The name originates from the Latin 'Britannia', the 'Great' being introduced to distinguish it from Little Britain, which was the French province later called Bretagne, or Brittany. The island of Rockall, several hundred miles out in the Atlantic, is
 legally part of Scotland, although actually closer to Ireland; the
 British claim to the island is disputed by the Irish Republic. Some,
 though not many, administrative bodies have jurisdiction over Great
 Britain. Great Britain was a Kingdom from 1707 to 1800, but no longer
 is.</p>
       <h3><a name="uk"></a>4. The United Kingdom</h3>
       <p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland together make up the United
 Kingdom, hence the full name (&quot;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and
 Northern Ireland&quot;). I suspect that the UK is probably the only country
 in the world whose average inhabitant has no idea what its legal name
 actually is. This defines the area represented in the UK Parliament
 and for which that Parliament normally makes laws. It is also a
 citizenship unit (although only since 1981). It does not define the
 area for which the UK government is responsible in international law -
 see below.</p>
       <h3><a name="ukki"></a>5. The United Kingdom and Islands</h3>
       <p>This includes a further three jurisdictions which have never been part
 of England, Wales, Scotland or Ireland and are not part of the UK but
 over which the Queen is sovereign and for which the UK government is
 internationally responsible. They are the Isle of Man, in the Irish
 Sea between England, Scotland and Ireland, and the Bailiwicks of
 Guernsey and Jersey, which are the two parts of the Channel Islands,
 off the coast of France, and were part of the Duchy of Normandy before
 William I conquered England in 1066. Alderney and Sark are subordinate
 parts of the Bailiwick of Guernsey. All of these territories have their own representative institutions and laws (offshore  banking and stamps looming large as in many 
 small territories). They are British Possessions, but not colonies, 
 and their inhabitants, unlike those of colonies, are British citizens 
 (except for EU purposes).</p>
       <h3><a name="bi"></a>6. The British Isles</h3>
       <p>Another geographical term referring to the whole group of islands
 adjoining Great Britain, including Ireland. Politically it includes
 the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the Isle of Man.
 Usage is not consistent as to whether the Channel Islands are included
 - geographically they should not be, politically they should. Irish
 people may detect political implications in this term, and it tends to
 be avoided, although there is no obvious alternative. The term used in
 connection with the Northern Irish peace process is just &quot;the Isles&quot;,
 which could be anywhere. One obvious alternative, &quot;Great Britain and
 Ireland&quot;, is also avoided because it used to be part of the title of
 the British monarch (1801-1927). See next paragraph for &quot;British
 Islands&quot;.</p>
       <h3><a name="cta"></a>7. The Common Travel Area</h3>
       <p>This is the area from which people can enter UK ports without being
 subject to routine immigration control. Same as the previous, but
 includes the Channel Islands. The legal term &quot;British Islands&quot; meant
 this area up to 1978, but now excludes the Republic (Interpretation
 Act 1978) so means the same as 5 above (including the Channel
 Islands). Immigration control has never been applied to Republic of
 Ireland citizens, who are also entitled to vote if resident in the UK
 and in general are not treated as aliens. The Irish Republic has
 recently, as part of the peace process, extended the same treatment to
 UK citizens.</p>
       <h3><a name="etuk"></a>8. The European Territories of the United Kingdom</h3>
       <p>This means the United Kingdom and Islands, plus Gibraltar, which is a
 British Colony with its own citizenship. Citizens of all parts of this
 area are UK Nationals in European Union law.</p>
       <h3><a name="eu"></a>9. The European Union</h3>
       <p>The UK and Republic of Ireland are among the 15 members of the EU,
 which is an international organisation, not a state, although it has
 its own law, which is directly applicable in all member states through
 their own courts. Citizens of all of these states are EU citizens and
 have the right to settle in any member state, and in the UK can vote
 in local but not national elections. The Isle of Man and the Channel
 Islands are not strictly part of the EU, their relationship with it
 being governed by special ad hoc arrangements.</p>
       <h3><a name="ukc"></a>10. The United Kingdom and Colonies</h3>
       <p>This is the total area for which the UK government has international
 responsibility. The remaining colonies (none of which has a population
 of more than 70,000) are mainly in the Caribbean and Pacific. The full
 title, rarely used, is &quot;The United Kingdom, Islands, and Colonies&quot;.
 The alternative term &quot;British Empire&quot; is no longer used, and 'colony' is falling out of favour and being replaced with 'dependent territory'. The extension of full British 
 citizenship to these territories is under way.</p>
       <h3><a name="c"></a>11. The Commonwealth</h3>
       <p>The Commonwealth (known until 1950 as the British Commonwealth, or the
 British Commonwealth of Nations) is an international organisation
 most, though not all, of whose members were once British colonies.
 Most Commonwealth countries are republics, although some (such as
 Canada) have Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. She is also
 Head of the Commonwealth, a role which involves no constitutional
 functions. These positions are entirely separate from each other; no
 other member of the Commonwealth is in any way subordinate to the
 United Kingdom. Commonwealth countries are not &quot;foreign&quot;; their
 citizens are not aliens in the UK, and can vote, although they are now
 subject to the same immigration controls as aliens. The Republic of
 Ireland is not a member of the Commonwealth, although it is also not a
 &quot;foreign&quot; country (Ireland Act 1949).</p>
       <h2>&quot;British&quot; and &quot;Britain&quot;</h2>
       <p>Like the USA, the UK suffers from having no convenient adjective to
 describe the country or its people. The best thing that can be said
 for &quot;British&quot; is that it is not quite as misleading as &quot;American&quot;, but
 it is nevertheless the established term for &quot;relating to the UK&quot;. So
 &quot;British citizen&quot; is correct (though only since 1981 - see below).
 This causes endless confusion and a fair amount of ill-will when
 applied to the people of Northern Ireland. They are British citizens,
 and so &quot;British&quot; in that sense (although they can also be citizens of
 the Republic of Ireland if they wish, as many do). They are not from
 Great Britain, so they are not &quot;British&quot; in that sense (i.e. as
 distinct from Irish).</p>
       <p>There is no satisfactory noun for &quot;British person&quot;, either. &quot;Briton&quot;
 is too formal, &quot;Brit&quot; too informal, and &quot;Britisher&quot; just foreign. All
 are best avoided.
 	
 The term &quot;British subject&quot;, in its original sense, is obsolete. It
 used to mean anyone who owed allegiance to the British sovereign, and
 therefore included citizens of independent Commonwealth countries as
 well as the UK. The modern equivalent is &quot;Commonwealth citizen&quot;.
 &quot;British subject&quot; is now used as shorthand for a Commonwealth citizen
 who is not a citizen of any country. Such a person, who would
 otherwise be entirely stateless, is entitled to a passport issued by
 the British government.</p>
       <p>There was no separate UK citizenship until 1948, when the term
 &quot;citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies&quot; was used. Since 1981 it
 has been &quot;British citizen&quot; (the first use of the term &quot;British&quot; in
 this context). &quot;UK national&quot; is a technical term of EU law with a
 slightly different meaning (see 8 above).</p>
       <p>So what about &quot;Britain&quot;? This is not a term with any legal meaning,
 but if you ask the English person in the street what country they live
 in surveys show that more will answer &quot;Britain&quot; than anything else. So
 it should probably be taken as a back-formation from &quot;British&quot;, and
 therefore to mean &quot;United Kingdom&quot;.</p>
       <h2>Sport</h2>
       <p>Most people probably encounter foreign countries through their sports
 teams more often than in any other way. We create even greater
 confusion here, since practice varies between different sports. In
 most older sports (e.g. rugby) there are teams representing the
 historic nations of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. In others
 (e.g. soccer) there are separate teams for Northern Ireland and the
 Republic of Ireland. There may also be teams representing the whole of
 the British Isles (rugby again). It is only in the Olympic Games,
 where participation is strictly on the basis of nationality, and in
 sports focussed on the Olympics, such as track and field athletics,
 that a UK or &quot;British&quot; team is likely to feature. As a final
 curiosity, our leading cricket team, although always called &quot;England&quot;,
 actually represents England and Wales. Scotland and Ireland have their
 own teams.</p>
       <h2>Historical and foreign usages</h2>
       <p>The correct and careful use of such terms as &quot;United Kingdom&quot; in any
 context other than the strictly legal is a recent development, dating
 from about the 1930s, when modern Scottish nationalism became a live
 political issue. Anything written before that date, even by
 historians, is likely to use &quot;England&quot;. Disraeli famously signed the
 1878 Treaty of Berlin as &quot;Prime Minister of England&quot;, to the dismay of
 his Foreign Office advisers. And A.J.P. Taylor, in the preface to his
 volume of the &quot;Oxford History of England&quot;, published in 1965, had to
 point out that &quot;when the Oxford History was launched a generation ago
 'England' was still an all-embracing word. It meant indiscriminately
 England and Wales, Great Britain, the United Kingdom, and even the
 British Empire.&quot; As a result of this, the usual term in most foreign
 languages has always been &quot;England&quot;, and will probably continue to be
 so for some time yet.</p>
