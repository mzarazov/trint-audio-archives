              <p>A report on the 11 June 2006 London boink was posted 
                to the newsgroup by Laura and is reproduced here:</p>
              <p class="bq">On a hot day the 7th floor restaurant at Tate Modern is a very good  place to be - air-conditioned, lovely view and not bad food and drink.</p>
              <p class="bq">Stephanie arrived bearing delicious samples of Brussels' best - yummy  chocolate-covered ginger, snobinettes (which she awarded to me for  knowing not only what they are but also how they are made by top  chocolatiers) and an intriguing set of chocolates which claimed to make  one serene, tranquil, sexy etc (we ate them all but there was no  observable difference to report).</p>
              <p class="bq">Chris W at her first ever boink displayed a slightly alarming tendency  to want to keep us on topic. She dismissed the (admittedly florid)  dessert menu in the style of a dedicated aue-er: &quot;I can't order anything  with so many..</p>
              <p class="bq">&lt;You, gentle reader, may, expect that sentence to end with the word  &quot;calories&quot; but no...&gt;</p>
              <p class="bq">..adjectives.&quot;</p>
              <p class="bq">Three members of the party were accompanied by hats (yes, the Panama of  Power joined us!) The waitpersons seemed to object to them being placed  on the floor so an extra chair was commandeered for the purpose. We  explained &quot;titfer&quot; to Chris W who had never heard the word. She  resoonded by telling us about &quot;angelmaker&quot; (new to us and less innocuous  than a hat, it would appear).</p>
              <p class="bq">Discussion strayed to disused Underground stations and we agreed that  Mark Brader would probably know how many there are and where.</p>
              <p class="bq">Stephanie is apparently teaching herself Spanish by reading trashy  magazines and reported that her close reading of the Spanish equivalent  of &quot;Hello&quot; reveals that Brenda is Queen Isabel(sp?) therein.</p>
              <p class="bq">We discussed the aue portrait page and thought it might be a good idea  to designate as alumni those posters who are no longer around and to  link active ones to illustrative posts - at least I think that's what  the suggestion was - Chris W seemed to have some idea about how to do  this.</p>
              <p class="bq">There were cultural excursions. Graeme greeted me by telling me that the  display in the Turbine Hall has raised his blood pressure but Katy and I  found it intriguing.</p>
              <p class="bq"><a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/domesticincidents/default.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/domesticincidents/default.shtm</a></p>
              <p class="bq">We explored Level 5. Mike L described a rather gloomy Cezanne as &quot;too  dark to be domestic&quot;, which sounds to me as if it should be the title of  something. Christian Marclay's Video Quartet is fascinating - very  difficult to describe but well worth a visit. <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/marclay-video-quartet-t11818" target="_blank">http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/marclay-video-quartet-t11818</a></p>
              <p class="bq">Some pictures were taken which will eventually appear, I expect.</p>
              <p class="bq">Special thanks to Stephanie for schlepping the chocs. </p>
