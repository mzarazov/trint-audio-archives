Toughie #1: Describe the preparation of a chip butty in exacting detail with precise English grammar.</p>
   <pre>Aaron J Dinkin (with grateful appreciation to Laura Spira and Stephen Toogood):
&gt;Put a pot of beef dripping on to heat at a low temperature. Peel four
&gt;large floury-variety potatoes, rinse them, and put them into a bowl
&gt;of cold water. Cut the potatoes into strips that are approximately
&gt;half an inch wide and two inches long. Put the chips in a bowl of
&gt;fresh water until the beef dripping has reached 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
&gt;For best results, cook the chips in batches so they don't all lump
&gt;together. Take the first batch out of the water, dry the chips off,
&gt;put them into a chip basket, and lower them into the beef dripping.
&gt;Let them cook for five to six minutes, or until they get 
&gt;flabby-looking and are soft but not browned; drain them; and put them  
&gt;to one side. Raise the temperature of the beef dripping to 360 degrees  
&gt;Fahrenheit and plunge the chips into the hot beef dripping to brown.
&gt;This should only take two to three minutes. Afterwards, put the chips
&gt;on a hot serving dish and keep them warm in the oven at 275 F. Spread
&gt;white bread thickly with butter. Make a half-sandwich of the bread
&gt;and chips by folding single slices of white bread around generous
&gt;helpings of chips, adding salt, vinegar, and ketchup. A good chip 
&gt;butty should have more chips than bread and should ooze butter and
&gt;ketchup when bitten. Serve with a glass of beer.</pre>

&gt;(All four are women who have written novels on which a well-known Broadway

Toughie #5: If an infinite number of rednecks riding in an infinite number of pickup trucks fire an infinite number of shotgun rounds at an infinite number 
 of highway signs, what will happen?</p>
   <pre>Broggers:
&gt;Strictly speaking the answer is indeterminate since infinity is not a
&gt;well-defined number. Contrast the three following examples:
&gt;
&gt;First case: We have N pick-up trucks carrying 2N rednecks and there are
&gt;N/5 highway signs. If we assume that the rednecks all fire their first
&gt;round at the same time then after the first round of shots there will
&gt;be on average 10 shots through each highway sign. In the limit where N
&gt;tends to infinity, with probability 1 we can say that the complete
&gt;works of Shakespeare (and any other work of literature for that matter)
&gt;will appear an infinite number of times. The same will hold after each
&gt;further round of shots.
&gt;
&gt;Second case: We have N pick-up trucks carrying 2N rednecks and there
&gt;are N/5 highway signs. This time we assume that the rednecks all fire
&gt;their shots randomly, and take a finite amount of time to reload. In
&gt;the limit N tends to infinity, at any instant with probability 1 the
&gt;complete works of Shakespeare will appear an infinite number of times.
&gt;However each appearance will only last for an infinitesimal amount of
&gt;time until further shots make the text unreadable.
&gt;
&gt;Third case: We have N*N pick-up trucks carrying 2N*N rednecks and there
&gt;are N/5 highway signs. If we assume that the rednecks all fire their
&gt;first round at the same time then after the first round of shots there
&gt;will be on average 10N shots through each highway sign. In the limit
&gt;where N tends to infinity with probability 1 we can say that the
&gt;highway signs will be completely obliterated instantaneously, and the
&gt;complete works of Shakespeare will hence never appear on the signs.
&gt;
&gt;In summary, in the first case the complete works of Shakespeare appear
&gt;an infinite number of times. In the second case the complete works of
&gt;Shakespeare also appear an infinite number of times but are only ever
&gt;present for an instant. In the third case the complete works of
&gt;Shakespeare never appear.
&gt;
&gt;It is a simple matter to invent some even more ridiculous examples, but
&gt;the conclusion is that the answer is indeterminate based on the
&gt;information provided.</pre>

5. While travelling through an ancient forest, you encounter a heavily armed dwarf accompanied by a minstrel. What is the correct greeting in this situation?</p>
   <pre>
Fabian:
&gt;One of,
&gt;
&gt;Hail and well met.
&gt;
&gt;Howdy Rumplestiltskin, long time no see!

Aaron J Dinkin:
&gt;Is there an explanation for this one?

Garry J. Vass:
&gt;Fair enough.
&gt;
&gt;Given that the dwarf is heavily armed, it is a safe bet that she expects
&gt;trouble in the forest; and is at a clear disadvantage in combat because a
&gt;minstrel generally cannot heal serious wounds.  Hence, although deadly
&gt;dangerous in combat, she will engage in combat only as a last resort.  She
&gt;is unable to heal any wounds she might endure.  That's why she's waiting for
&gt;your greeting.
&gt;
&gt;Given that you were not cut down as you approached by a bolt from the
&gt;minstrel's crossbow, there's a good chance she suspects you might be useful.
&gt;
&gt;Given that you are human (that's a fair bet), it is probable that you
&gt;possess innate healing ability, healing potions (important to the dwarf),
&gt;and more importantly, charisma (important to the minstrel).
&gt;
&gt;Being human, you realise that the dwarf can provide [1] invaluable
&gt;protection against hostile adversaries; and [2] inflict serious damage in
&gt;melee combat.
&gt;
&gt;And the minstrel can [1] assist in your understanding of lore; [2] gather
&gt;information; [3] provide a ranged weapon in combat (crossbow); [4] barter
&gt;for food and supplies; and [5] perhaps pick a few locks here and there where
&gt;needed.
&gt;
&gt;Based upon this, it makes sense to befriend them, to demonstrate human
&gt;charisma, and to offer a greeting which is acknowledged by dwarven folk as
&gt;friendly:  &quot;Hail and well met&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;That's the explanation.  Had it been a dwarf and a mage (or anything else),
&gt;the answer would have been *completely* different.
&gt;
&gt;I might add that this was a *very* tough question, and it's quite pleasing
&gt;that Fabian managed to sort it.</pre>

   <pre>
Tootsie hinted:
&gt;Maybe our entrants would benefit from a look at a pear tree and said tree's

Aaron J Dinkin:
&gt; I tried looking up &quot;Back Pan&quot; in Eric Partridge's _Dictionary of Slang and
&gt; Unconventional English_ and _Origins_ but didn't find anything. Partridge
&gt; wrote several more works on the English language that I don't have access
&gt; to at the moment; if you can check them, perhaps you'll be luckier than I.

Garry hinted:
&gt; Probably stopped at 'z' also, right?

Aaron J Dinkin:
&gt;What are you trying to tell me, that there's a section in Partridge's
&gt;_Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English_ beyond &quot;Z&quot;? Ha! Some
&gt;Appendix or something, perhaps one on Railwaymen's Slang and
&gt;Nicknames? One that on page 531 of the 1990 _Concise_ edition identifies
&gt;&quot;The Back Pan&quot; as referring to Washwood Heath? Ha! again I say.</pre>

Alex Chernavsky:
&gt; The question refers to a song by the rock band Traffic.  The song is called,
&gt; &quot;The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys&quot;, and it was released in 1971.  The
&gt; songwriters were Steve Winwood and Jim Capaldi.  Steve Winwood went on to
&gt; have a fairly successful solo career.  I'm not sure what happened to Jim
&gt; Capaldi.

14. An uncommon name in common: Kingly worship, wartime betrayal down by the riverside, and an erstwhile economist. What uncommon name connects these three, and how?</p>
   <pre>
John Rickard:
&gt;Taking &quot;economist&quot; in a wide sense, the erstwhile economist is that
&gt;spirited time-traveller, Ebenezer Scrooge.
&gt;
&gt;A search of the Web reveals that the wartime betrayal was the betrayal
&gt;at Ebenezer Creek during the American Civil War.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know about the kingly worship; perhaps something to do with
&gt;the musician Ebenezer Prout, who edited Handel's Messiah?
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, the uncommon name is Ebenezer.

John Holmes:
&gt;... and the name Ebenezer means 'stone of help', which GJV alluded to in
&gt;another thread.

John Holmes again:
&gt; And it was aslo the name of the King family's church. Martin Luther King
&gt; Jr's father became pastor there in 1931. Hence Kingly worship.</pre>

17. What was found in Relay 70, Panel F?</p>
   <pre>
Richard Fontana:
&gt; A bug -- more accurately, a moth
&gt;
&gt;From the Jargon File:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Admiral Grace Hopper (an early computing pioneer better known for
&gt;inventing COBOL) liked to tell a story in which a technician solved a
&gt;glitch in the Harvard Mark II machine by pulling an actual insect out from
&gt;between the contacts of one of its relays, and she subsequently
&gt;promulgated bug in its hackish sense as a joke about the incident (though,
&gt;as she was careful to admit, she was not there when it happened). For many
&gt;years the logbook associated with the incident and the actual bug in
&gt;question (a moth) sat in a display case at the Naval Surface Warfare
&gt;Center (NSWC). The entire story, with a picture of the logbook and the
&gt;moth taped into it, is recorded in the &quot;Annals of the History of
&gt;Computing&quot;, Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1981), pp. 285-286. 
&gt;
&gt;&quot;The text of the log entry (from September 9, 1947), reads &quot;1545 Relay #70
&gt;Panel F (moth) in relay. First actual case of bug being found&quot;. This
&gt;wording establishes that the term was already in use at the time in its
&gt;current specific sense -- and Hopper herself reports that the term `bug'
&gt;was regularly applied to problems in radar electronics during WWII. 
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Indeed, the use of `bug' to mean an industrial defect was already
&gt;established in Thomas Edison's time ....&quot;</pre>

&gt;&quot;Mousehole is located just three miles westward around Mounts Bay from
&gt;Penzance and is one of the most beautiful coastal villages in Britain....
&gt;The village, whose name is pronounced &quot;Mowzel&quot;, is centred around a nearly
&gt;circular harbour protected from the force of the sea coming across Mounts
&gt;Bay by two sturdy breakwaters....  It was in Mousehole that lived Dolly
&gt;Pentreath, reputedly the last person who spoke the Cornish language as her
&gt;natural tongue, which died with her some 200 years ago. A memorial to her
&gt;is to be found in the churchyard at Paul, a small village just above
&gt;Mousehole. In recent years, this ancient Celtic language has undergone an

&gt;I'm guessing on &quot;tights&quot;.  For &quot;slip road&quot;, &quot;exit&quot; would also do.
&gt;&quot;Gam&quot; is bipondian as far as I know, though hardly current usage
&gt;leftpondwise, so I did not translate it into &quot;leg&quot;.

Tootsie:
&gt;As others have said, &quot;tights&quot; are usually called &quot;pantyhose&quot; in the US,
&gt;but there are plenty of people (men especially, I think) who still say
&gt;&quot;stockings&quot; even if the &quot;stockings&quot; are one-piece pantyhose. As for
&gt;&quot;gam,&quot; readers of older tough detective novels (the &quot;older&quot; refers to
&gt;the novels; the &quot;tough&quot; refers to the tecs) will be familiar with it. In
&gt;fact, older people who *don't* read detective novels will know what a
&gt;&quot;gam&quot; is, I'll bet. (Again, men especially, I think.)
&gt;
&gt;And...since we don't discriminate here on the basis of age or sex or

45. What word describes an English property owner's right to have rainwater drip from his roof on to the property of someone else?</p>
   <pre>
Richard Fontana:
&gt;The corresponding term in *Roman* Law is stillicidium.
&gt;See &lt;<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09079a.htm">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09079a.htm</a>&gt;; 
&gt;&lt;http://www.supremelaw.com/ref/dict/bldd2.htm&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;I do not believe it is correct to say that &quot;stillicidium&quot; is the official
&gt;term for the *English* property owner's right, since the English common
&gt;law of property does not generally follow the Roman Law tradition, and I
&gt;believe that the proper term is &quot;right of drip&quot;; since a single word is
&gt;asked for, it would be &quot;easement&quot;, the right of drip being a particular
&gt;type of easement.
&gt;(Cf.: &quot;Right of drip} (Law), an easement or servitude by which a
&gt;        man has the right to have the water flowing from his house
&gt;        fall on the land of his neighbor.&quot;
&gt;Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913), quoted at
&gt;&lt;http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=drip&gt;)
&gt;
&gt;However, I believe that the SDC Panel is probably looking for a specific
&gt;word like &quot;stillicidium&quot;, and not a general word like &quot;easement&quot;, and in
&gt;fact I am reasonably certain that this Roman Law term has been referred to
&gt;in English case law dealing with the Right of Drip, so my final answer is
&gt;&quot;Stillicidium&quot;.  And it is probably not incorrect to say that the Roman
&gt;Law term *describes* the English property owner's right.

Jerry Friedman:
&gt;In fact, it's in the NSOED.  So is the more English &quot;stillicide&quot;, and
&gt;that's my answer.
&gt;
&gt;I've seen this word in only one place: Vladimir Nabokov's amazing novel
&gt;_Pale Fire_.  John Shade, in his poem, refers to icicles as
&gt;
&gt;                         the svelte

46. Mildly negative noun, whose etymology is derived from a conjurer's word, and ultimately from the Basque word for 'God'. What is it?</p>
   <pre>
Alex Chernavsky:
&gt;Jingo
&gt;
&gt;====Begin quote====
&gt;
&gt;jainko The ordinary word for `god' (in the generic sense) and also, as
&gt;Jainko, a name for `God' (in the Christian sense). The word has a variant
&gt;Jinko, and it is a puzzle. The most widespread name for the Christian God is
&gt;Jaungoikoa, from jaun `lord' and goiko `who is on high', plus the article.
&gt;This name too is odd, since the order of elements is very un-Basque: we
&gt;would have expected *Goikojauna. It may be that Jaungoikoa has its anomalous
&gt;form because it is a calque on some Romance term of the form `the Lord on
&gt;high', but nobody knows. The word Jainko is still in use today, especially
&gt;in the north, and in early texts it is often more frequent than Jaungoikoa.
&gt;There are at least three hypotheses on the table concerning these two words.
&gt;(1) Jainko is an ancient Basque word for `God' (possibly deriving from the
&gt;name of a pre-Christian deity), and Jaungoiko is a folk-etymology designed
&gt;to rationalize this name in Christian terms, thus accounting for the odd
&gt;form of the latter. (2) Jainko is nothing but an irregular contraction of
&gt;Jaungoiko. (3) The two names are not related at all, and the resemblance is
&gt;purely coincidental. I myself favor the third of these, but I take no
&gt;position on the origin of jainko. I note two things, however. First, it is
&gt;extremely rare for a Basque noun to begin with j. Second, the presence of
&gt;the cluster nk is highly anomalous: save only in the easternmost dialects,
&gt;plosives in all Basque words, of whatever origin, were uniformly voiced
&gt;after n some centuries after the Roman period, and hence this word does not
&gt;look ancient: we would have expected *jaingo. Finally, the oft-made
&gt;suggestion that English By jingo! derives from Basque Ala jinko! `By God!'
&gt;seems too fanciful to be taken seriously, especially since English loans
&gt;directly from Basque are virtually unknown.

&gt; You just need to think clearly. Ask yourself what the modifying phrase is
&gt; talking about, and then put it next to that thing. For example, you can

&gt;is to say that the writing was on the back of the envelope, it
&gt;contains an obvious error of style, discussed elsewhere in the

Mark Barratt:
&gt;It looked like Gwen struck lucky to me - it appears that Gwen guessed

&gt;that the highest shirt number is 44. The Totally Official answer was
&gt;that &quot;Pompey whore&quot; is rhyming slang for &quot;forty-four&quot;, although the
&gt;only reference to this that anyone found said that it should be 24.

&gt;A kind of gun or cannon.
&gt;
&gt;-------------------------------------
&gt;From &lt;URL:http://www.urbanlegends.com/language/etymology/brass_monkey_more.html&gt;
&gt;
&gt;According to the Concise OED, the two volume version with four-pages-in-one
&gt;printed in micro lettering, it is &quot;a kind of gun or cannon.&quot; The usage seems
&gt;to be archaic. The dictionary cites a 1650 book called Art. Rendition Edinbur.
&gt;Castle as referring to &quot;28 short brass munkeys alias dogs&quot;, and a 1663 (1672)
&gt;publication called Flagellum, O Cromwell as referring to &quot;Twenty eight brass
&gt;drakes called Monkeys.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;How this relates to 'freeze the balls off a brass monkey' is unclear, but
&gt;[...]
&gt;Perhaps it is a reference to the coefficient of expansion, ie; if it was very
&gt;cold, perhaps the muzzle of the cannon was too small to prevent the iron balls
&gt;from being loaded (differing coefficients of expansion)? I may be stretching
&gt;the point a bit, but food for thought anyway.

&gt; Jr.  The Bobby Kennedy and James Hoffa answers were just playing it safe.
&gt; One associates them with teamsters, and perhaps with warning teamsters in
&gt; some way.
&gt;
&gt; As for Charles Riggs and Reinhold Aman:  The key there is Ray
&gt; Charles, though Ray Charles was itself not the answer (as I imagined it).
&gt; Ray Charles was a pop pitchman.  Charles is the first name of Charles
&gt; Riggs.  A teamster drives a truck; a truck can be called a 'rig',
&gt; misspelled 'rigg' and pluralized 'riggs'.  Meanwhile, 'Ray' and 'Rey' are
&gt; (I assume) homophones.  (Is the first syllable of 'Reinhold' more like
&gt; 'rhine' or 'rain'?)  And Reinhold Aman is Aman, while Ray Charles and
&gt; Charles Riggs are each also a man.  Also, some of Reinhold Aman's actions
&gt; on AUE might be viewed as an attack on 'teamsters' (i.e., conformists,
&gt; anti-iconoclasts).</pre>

Tootsie:
&gt;Someone (maybe more than one) pointed out that there's another [Abbott &amp;
&gt;Costello] version, using &quot;damn&quot; instead of &quot;darn.&quot;  There probably is,
&gt;but the &quot;darn&quot; version would certainly have been used by A &amp; C on the
&gt;Colgate Comedy Hour (on TV, brought to you by the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet
&gt;Company) in the early 50s. &quot;Darn&quot; was most likely used by them on radio,
&gt;too.

87. Churchill, Rothmans, and Todd. Where?</p>
   <pre>
Mark Barratt:
&gt; Australia

Jitze:
&gt; Booked and recorded too early for my liking - all very well to bang
&gt; in a one-word answer and hit &quot;send&quot; in the interests of racing
&gt; to the post - but some other panel members might like to
&gt; see some of the reasoning behind the answer...even if it is
&gt; in a leisurely follow-up.

Mark Barratt:
&gt;Ok, here was my reasoning Jitze: The words Churchill, Rothmans, and
&gt;Todd when entered into a search engine produce hits on the subject of
&gt;Australian rugby. The question says &quot;Where?&quot; rather than &quot;What?&quot; so I
&gt;concluded that the TO answer *might* have been &quot;Australia&quot;. I am an
&gt;expert on neither Australia nor rugby, and in the latter case have no
&gt;interest, either. It would have taken considerably more time to
&gt;ascertain the information that Garry has posted in reply to you, and I
&gt;still wouldn't have been 100% confident that it was correct, because
&gt;there could (and arguably should) have been a more esoteric solution.

&gt;Chevron, found in several coats of arms?

Aaron J Dinkin:
&gt; Okay, Bob, if you insist.... I'll take it. &quot;Infinity&quot;.

John O'Flaherty:
&gt;Are you sirius?</pre>
   <p class="also">Also:</p>
   <pre>
Lars Eighner:
&gt;The dog days are the forty days centered on the conjunction of the Sun
&gt;and Sirius (most of July and the first third of August,
&gt;approximately).  In the midst of the dog days Sirius is not visible
&gt;owing to its proximity to the Sun on the celestial sphere.  It was
&gt;once believed that the heat of this season was caused by the heat of
&gt;Sirius (the brightest fixed object in the sky) being added to the heat
&gt;of the Sun - a theory which fails miserably in the Southern Hemisphere
&gt;where the dog days occur in the dead of winter.
&gt;
&gt;See <a href="http://wilstar.com/dogdays.htm">http://wilstar.com/dogdays.htm</a>
&gt;
&gt;The helical rising of Sirius is the beginning of the ancient Egyptian
&gt;new year, because this marks the season of the annual flooding of the
&gt;Nile.  This is etymologically related to &quot;dog days,&quot; but as we all
&gt;know by now, etymology is not definition.</pre>

Aaron J Dinkin:
&gt;Revised guess: _all_ sixteen words come from the same Indo-European root
&gt;(namely *&quot;dheu-&quot;). I'm not sure what the significance of the four sets is,
&gt;if any.</pre>
