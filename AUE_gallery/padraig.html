  <a name="pronunciation"></a>People have shown interest in the origin and pronunciation of the name &quot;Padraig Breathnach&quot;. Padraig writes:</p>
 <h3 align="left">
  &quot;Padraig&quot;</h3>
 <p align="left">First, a minor point with which I do not 
  burden people in AUE: the proper Gaelic spelling is "P&aacute;draig"; an 
  equally-common version is "P&aacute;draic".</p>
 <p align="left">"Padraig" comes from the Latin 
  "Patricius". St Patrick was from Wales, and was a member of a Roman or a 
  Romanised family. More likely Romanised, as his Latin was, apparently, not 
  very good. [There is a story that his mother came from France, from Touraine, 
  and that Patrick was related to St. Martin of Tours.]</p>
 <p align="left">The Irish Celtic 
  people had difficulty with the name because of the phonic system they had 
  available to them. One early Irish version was "Coithric" (pronounced 
  something like "CUH-rick"). The initial "C" came in because "P" was not 
  generally used in Gaelic. Other early versions have the "P".</p>
 <p align="left">The "t" in 
  "Patricius" was effectively cancelled. In Gaelic, where either "d" or "t" is 
  followed by "r" it often elided.</p>
 <p align="left">Over time, more Gaelic people acquired 
  the "P" sound, and the "Coithric" version dropped out of use.</p>
 <p align="left">In some 
  Gaelic dialects there appears to have been an incorrect reversal if the 
  elision of the "t". It was restored as a "d". That is reflected in modern 
  spelling, and in the pronunciation of "P&aacute;draig" in some dialects 
  today.</p>
 <p align="left">My preferred pronunciation is something like "PAW-rick"; others 
  have suggested "PORR-ic", and I would not argue too strongly with them. It's 
  somewhere in there.</p>
 <p align="left">There are other pronunciations which are also 
  correct if one speaks a different dialect of Gaelic.</p>
 <h3 align="left">&quot;Breathnach&quot;</h3>
 <p align="left">There are two major groups of Celtic peoples in this 
  part of the world: The Goidels and the Brythons. These terms are favoured by 
  scholars. In popular usage, one finds the versions "Gael" and 
  "Briton".</p>
 <p align="left">The Goidelic people are the Irish, the Scots, and the Manx. 
  They are also classed as the Q-Celts because they used a "q" or hard "c" sound 
  in certain words (e.g. "ceann" for "head").</p>
 <p align="left">The Brythonic people 
  include the Welsh, the Cornish, and the Bretons. They are classed as P-Celts 
  because they used the "p" sound where the Goidels used the "q" sound ("pen" 
  for "head").</p>
 <p align="left">In Gaelic, the word "Breathnach" means "Brythonic". This 
  is not the same as "British" in the modern sense. It is narrower in 
  application, referring to Celtic people. Because the Irish have had far more 
  interaction with the Welsh than with the other Brythonic peoples, it is often 
  used simply to mean "Welsh". In fact, that is the common anglicisation of the 
  name: Walsh or Welsh. </p>
 <p align="left">I find it difficult to give anything other than 
  a crude guide to pronunciation. One might say "BRANN-och" and not be too far 
  off. But it is not quite right.</p>
 <ol>
  <li>
          <div align="left">The "r" is what we describe as narrow, and has some resemblance to the 
    French rolled "r". 
    </div>
  <li>
   <div align="left">In the "th" group (can we call it a digraph?) the "h" indicates that the 
    "t" is elided; it leaves a very subtle, almost undetectable, schwa. 
    </div>
  <li>
          <div align="left">In the "ch" group the "h" again indicates elision, but the elision is 
    not total; it becomes something like a very gentle clearing of the throat. 
    </div>
  </li>
