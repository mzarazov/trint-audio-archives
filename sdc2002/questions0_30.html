You will have heard of my grandfather.  His myth is known
throughout the world. My myth is more localized.  After leaving
the place of my birth, I travelled  for many years until I came
to a hill by a river.  The hill boasted a forest  of magnificent pine
trees.  I settled there and founded a city.  Settlers came
and used these pine trees to build walls and a fortress within
these walls.  The  fortress was given a name which some believe
comes from a word meaning "hard",  but others believe its name
comes from words meaning "pine forest".  All agree  that the name
given to the oldest tower of this fortress (frequently photographed
by tourists) comes from a ancient word meaning "known only to the
initiated".   The wooden walls stood for several centuries and were
replaced with white stone,  and finally brick.
            
      <p>
I gave my name to this city.  It has produced composers,
artists, and novelists.   One citizen of legend even travelled
to the fabled Camelot to joust with the  Arthurian knights.
Sadly however, his name was mistranslated to a colour,
rather than the correct meaning of "beautiful".
            
      <p>
In time, I married a local woman who bore a son and daughter.
Their names  were combined and given as an eponym to a river
in this region.
            
      <p>
Today, the city I founded is a vibrant metropolis with an airport
and tube system,  and my citizens are fiercely proud of the heritage
 I bestowed upon them.  Please  provide [1] the name of my
grandfather; and [2] the name of the fortress.  Please include
a rationale for your answer.
            
      <p>
Note that if the answer to the next question is an odd number,
then the  answer to question 53 can be found in a handbook.

Vsevolod I Grand Prince of Kiev was the grandfather of Yuri Dolgoruky
who founded Moscow.  But although his myth is certainly known to
Google, it wasn't to me.
            
      <p>
I suspect the better-known grandfather was Yuri's mother Gythe's father,
Harold II of England, who got one in the eye at Hastings.

Definitely the Kremlin.  'Kreml' meaning 'hard', it was originally
built of wood, then white stone, finally red brick.  (Some white
stone buildings and foundations remain.)

From which comes 'Red Square', derived from the Russian word 'krasnyj'
which means 'beautiful', but sounds like the word for 'red'.

<b>Demurrer posted:</b>
Sadly, per the cited fragment above, we cannot provide a full "Thank You"
because we're unable to locate a city named "Yuri" that has a Kremlin in it,
so it couldn't be his grandfather whose name we're seeking.

OK, Googling gives this:
            
      <p>
Moscow's origins have long been shrouded in the mystery of time, but there
are many stories linked with it. One legend has it that Moscow was founded
by Noah's grandson, Tsar Mosokh. On the site of a little hill, which is now
known as Shvivaya Gorka, he founded 'Gradets Maly', [little town] and
settled down there. Mosokh's wife was called Kva, and they had a son and
daughter called Ya and Vuza. These names were combined into the words
Moskva and Yauza, the latter being the name of Moscow's second largest
river.
            
      <p>
Ref:  
      http://www.rcscmalta.org/newsletter/feb2002.html 
            
      <p>
Interesting that Moscow had TWO founders with famous grandfathers.

You wouldn't think so to look at me, but I'm 72 now. Or is it 88? 90?
            
      <p>
And, oh, the places I've been. In a tunnel, for starters. One of
those secret tunnels you might read about but never see, much less
set foot in. It was sort of scary, but I wasn't really afraid. The
experience actually provided an answer to something I'd been
wondering about.
            
      <p>
I've been to more places than a kid my age ought to have been. But
I was a motherless child, you know... on my own a lot, going my own
way more than most of my friends. Fortunately, I never had to worry
about money. I even had a pretty snazzy car as a teenager.
            
      <p>
Some folks in your family -- maybe even you -- have probably read
about me, and feel they know me. Whether they "met" me years ago or
now, I'd seem much the same. Some things don't change.
            
      <p>
Who am I?  Please note that if I am female, then the fellow in
question 94 would probably not mention the first syllable of
his name in an English pub.  If I am male, then the SDC sanity
checkers raised no objections to the next question.

I believe the novel is Oliver Twist, and the fictional magistrate is
Mr. Fang.  His real-life counterpart was one Mr. Liang, whose given
name I've yet been unable to determine.

Whoops!  Typo!  It's Laing.  Here's an update:
            
      <p>
"Mr. Fang:  Mr. Fang was modeled on the Hatton Garden magistrate,
Allan Stewart Laing, who was attacked by others than Dickens for his
severity.  He was dismissed from the bench in January 1838, but I have
not found, in reports of his conduct on the bench in 1836, at any
rate, much foundation for charges about the 'ferocities of Laing'. "

The finger of Tsar Nicholas I, as legends have it, got in the way as he
ruled a line from St. Petersburg to Moscow, introducing a bump, which
was duly incorporated into the rail-way. Known as the Tsar's Finger,
this curve in the line was straightened recently, occassioning the
cessation of train movement for 24 hours.

	"The traditional Cumbrian sheep-counting words are (starting from one)<br>
	yan, tyan, tethera, methera, pimp, sethera, lethera, overa...

    So any anagrams of those last two are Totally Correct.
            However, the panel deemed the answer as provided to be correct, given the vagaries of Cumbrian spelling.

<b>After some demurral he followed up with:</b>
            
      <p>
Hmm. I did some research.  I guess I will have to change my bid.  I quote
from CHAPTER I THE BOBBSEY TWINS AT HOME
            
      <p>
"Nan was a tall and slender girl, with a dark face and red cheeks. Her eyes
were a deep brown and so were the curls that clustered around her head.
            
      <p>
    Bert was indeed a twin, not only because he was the same age as Nan, but
because he looked so very much like her. To be sure, he looked like a boy,
while she looked like a girl, but he had the same dark complexion, the same
brown eyes and hair, and his voice was very much the same, only stronger
            
      <p>
Freddie and Flossie were just the opposite of their larger brother and
sister. Each was short and stout, with a fair, round face, light-blue eyes
and fluffy golden hair. Sometimes Papa Bobbsey called Flossie his little Fat
Fairy, which always made her laugh. But Freddie didn't want to be called a
fairy, so his papa called him the Fat Fireman, which pleased him very much,
and made him rush around the house shouting: "Fire! fire! Clear the track
for Number Two! Play away, boys, play away!" in a manner that seemed very
lifelike."
            
      <p>
I can only conclude that Nan and Bert were a better match in appearance as
it was specifically pointed out.  Freddie & Flossie were twins but not quite
so well matched.
            
      <p>
(My original post was based on a review that stated Freddie & Flossie were
twins, while Nan & bert were older siblings.  It seems a poor choice of
source on my behalf)

Could it be from "Afton Water"?
            
 Thou stock-dove, whose echo resounds thro' the glen,<br>
 Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den,<br>
 Thou green-crested lapwing, thy screaming forbear,<br>
 I charge you disturb not my slumbering fair.<br>
            Kibitz comes from "kiebitz" which means lapwing or peewit, according to
NSOED, and since the lapwing is asked to forbear from screaming, and
kibitzers are expected to keep quiet, it seems appropriate.

If this is to do with "northern harrier" being an alternative name for "hen
harrier", then we should be looking for a species with two names, one of
which contains "boreal".

Now, the post by "toonice111" refers to the Boreal Owl.  Looking at the link
http://www.state.ak.us/local/akpages/FISH.GAME/notebook/bird/borealow.htm
this is Aegolius funereus.  In my bird-book, this is given as "Tengmalm's
Owl".

So I'll guess "Tengmalm's".
