I entered through the Red Gate and continued east. I passed the
Lime Kiln on my left, then Michael's Mead on my right. I reached
the Police and Fire Headquarters and turned south. After some time,
I crossed Yeoman's Bridge and continued south. To my right, I heard
the sounds of Accidental President. I continued south until I
encountered a perimeter fence. There, I spied an ancient monument,
revered by many as having both spiritual and mythological
significance.

It might not have been the grasshopper after all. There appear to be
variants
of the translation that suggest a cricket did the singing (more likely than
a grasshopper)
and this reference suggests a cicada which are clearly known for their
singing.

This looks like it's referring to somebody who complained that their country
was "full".  I'm sure that plenty of people have claimed this over the
years, but one who claimed it in 2002 was Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands.  I
don't see why the Netherlands are less full, though.

  I sailed west from this massive island, once visited by Marco Polo,
  until I saw the coastline of a small island named for its indigenous
  swine.  I turned due south and sailed until I reached a cluster of
  islands first charted by the Portuguese, one prominent island being
  named for a fortuitous event that occurred there in the 18th century.
  I then sailed due west for six days and then due south for twelve
  days.  Finally, I made landfall on an island whose legal system was
  based upon reward rather than punishment.  At that last stop, where
was I?

Aha! From Chapter 6:

===
It is upon this account that the image of Justice, in their courts of
judicature, is formed with six eyes, two before, as many behind, and on
each side one, to signify circumspection; with a bag of gold open in her
right hand, and a sword sheathed in her left, to show she is more
disposed to reward than to punish.
===

So the first island is Sumatra, the second Babi (just southeast of
Simuelue), the group is the Cocos or Keelings (or, if the navigator
didn't allow enough for the current when pricking his chart, Christmas
Island) and the last one is Lilliput.

Ring of the Troll
        <p>

This ring acts in all ways as a ring of regeneration or rapid regeneration,
but are in fact faulty versions of those rings, created through errors in
the making process. This is due the use of to much trollish blood in the
enchantment of the ring, these rings work normally, regenerating missing
parts and wounds, but replacing them with thair trollish equivalents. When
the wearer has regenerated as many Hps as hes miximum total, he is turned
into a troll (standard or your choice, it is up to DM as to what kind of
troll the ring was made from). This may not become immediately apparent as
the transformed parts may be hiddin under clothes, armor and so on. It can
be suppressed before it is completed, by a dispel magic, but afterwards only
by a wish or reincarnate spell.

        <p>
makes you a troll.

I sailed into the harbour, past the imposing guard towers,
and into the Great Port. I unloaded my cargo at the warehouse
and sailed north to the Internal Port. There, I disembarked and
found myself in a city with bronze walls!  Within this city, I found
a massive military fortress, the Royal Palace, and a sacred grove.
In the sacred grove, there was a temple (described by a Greek
philosopher as having silver walls and gold ornamentation) to a god
of the sea. Had I continued north for another mile, I would have
come to two very large structures dedicated to entertainment.
        <p>
Where was I? Who was the philosopher? And what was the chief
form of entertainment there?

I was born in the Southern Hemisphere in a city whose name means something
like "flower stream", but my parents were English. When I was three, my
mother returned to England with me. My father (a banker) was supposed to
follow us in the next year, but he contracted rheumatic fever and died. I
grew up near a city whose name is thought to come from the Old English
'residence of Beorma'. My fondest memory here was an old, rustic watermill
which fell into ruin. Later, I paid to have it restored, and it is now a
museum. What is the name of this watermill/museum?
