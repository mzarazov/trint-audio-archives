Assume that you are magically transported to Edwardian England and are given
10 pence. How many 10d nails could you buy?  If the answer to this question
is an even number, then the answer to a previous question is etymologically
related to the word "optical".  Otherwise, the nymph's name is not also an
eponym for a river.   If the registration number of the hired car was an odd
number, then a valid rationale for Q120 is "Because we said so".  Otherwise
the answer to the next question is "4 quarks and a cole-slaw on the side,
please".

To be *exact*, it's because they don't like it in there -- Chiquita
told me:
        <p>
"I'm Chiquita banana and I've come to say - Bananas have to ripen in a
certain way- When they are fleck'd with brown and have a golden hue -
Bananas taste the best and are best for you - You can put them in a
salad - You can put them in a pie-aye - Any way you want to eat them -
It's impossible to beat them - But, bananas like the climate of the
very, very tropical equator - So you should never put bananas in the
refrigerator."

History tells us that this national figure took up residence for
a brief period at the beginning of the 20th century in an area now
known as Clerkenwell Green, London EC1. History also tells us that he
had difficulty learning English, and that his spoken English had a
distinct regional accent. Please identify this person who later became
associated with a new phase in a nation's history, and for extra credit,
please identify the English accent with which he spoke.

It's an automatic announcement information station staff that there
is a fire alarm in the station.  A further automatic announcement will
order the evacuation of the station a few minutes later, if no one
intervenes to stop it (because they've checked out the problem).  Or
so it has been said in various threads in uk.transport.london.

You could call it a triple rhyme, with the three stressed vowels at the
end of each line being long a, long e, and long i.  (I won't venture

      The increase in day to day use of this modern artefact has
	  spawned the creation of new nomenclature for it
	  in many different languages. The source of these
	  names relates to creatures as diverse as
	  pachyderms, monkeys, and worms. But English seems
	  to be the exception.

In German, it is frequently called Klammeraffe, 'spider monkey' (you can
imagine the monkey's tail), though this word also has a figurative sense
very similar to that of the English 'leech' ("He grips like a leech").
Danish has grisehale, 'pig's tail' (as does Norwegian), but more
commonly calls it snabel a, 'a (with an) elephant's trunk', as does
Swedish, where it is the name recommended by the Swedish Language Board.

I was born in the era that some call the "pretty time period".
My father was a well-known painter and my mother was an accomplished
musician. I studied music for a bit, but changed my major to philosophy
and studied that in Marburg. After that, I returned home and worked in a
factory, and later in a library. Then I became interested in Shakespeare
and translated many of his works - my translations of Shakespeare are
still considered to be the finest in my native language. Finally, I
wrote and
published my own novel, for which I was awarded a Nobel Prize! My novel
was subsequently made into a Hollywood movie which was released about
the
time many aue civilians were teenagers.
