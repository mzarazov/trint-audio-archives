    resort in a<BR>country where English is just one of the primary languages. 
    <P>While on the beach, he heard a tour guide shoo away<BR>some persistent 
    beggars with the term "vamoose"--which<BR>surprised him, as he had only 
    encountered its use before in old<BR>cowboy films and novels about the Wild 
    West. Its origin,<BR>he was informed, was from the Spanish "vamos". 
    <P>Some time later he heard another tour guide use the term "piss 
    off"<BR>under similar circumstances. The origins of this were clearly 
    English.<BR>
    <P>A little later he heard another tour guide use another imperative<BR>in 
    similar circumstances. But this time the term sounded more like<BR>"foot 
    sack". At least--that's the phonetics he thought he heard.<BR>

    etymology of this term?

    <P>
    <DIV class=answer><B>A:</B> South Africa. It is usually spelled "voetsek" or 
    "voetsak" and derives from when a<BR>farmer (or boer) might urge his oxen 
    forward in Afrikaans with "Voort se ek"<BR>which derives in turn from the

    All people that on earth do dwell, or alternatively, all who dwell

    100), music by Louis <BR>Bourgeois, 1510-1561, words attributed to William 
    Kethe: 
    <P>All people that on earth do dwell, <BR>sing to the Lord with cheerful 
    voice. <BR>Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell; <BR>come ye before 
    him and rejoice. 
    <P>Alternative lyrics to this same tune are "From all who dwell beneath the 
    <BR>skies" and "Praise God from whom all blessings flow". <BR>Accordingly 
    anything like "all creatures here below and ye heavenly <BR>host" would also

    <DIV></DIV>
    <DIV class=question><B>Q:</B> I was born in the 1930s in the Big Apple, but 
    my ancestors originally <BR>came from a place in what some call "La Manche". 
    I was married in 1940 <BR>and my first daughter (whose name, although in a 
    different context, was <BR>sought in the 1998 SDC - and ultimately comes 
    from a Hebrew word meaning <BR>"married") was born in the same year. When I 
    went to Hollywood, my <BR>husband, whose name might mean "caretaker of trees 
    from Chichester" or <BR>possibly "protector", spent his evenings playing 
    poker. When I returned <BR>from Hollywood in 1941, I went on a tour of the 
    US. It was during this <BR>time that I began walking. After the War, I 
    returned to New York and had <BR>my second child. We named him after a 
    French word that means "Handsome <BR>Look". In 1957 I had twins in a place 
    that did not talk to Gimbels! <BR>Incredible to relate, in 1971 I was born 
    again(!), this time in a city <BR>whose name means "Land of Gold". I am 
    firmly entrenched in 20th century <BR>Americana, and of course you would 
    recognise my husband immediately as <BR>he gave his name to a common

    <DIV class=question><B>Q:</B> Some folks at Totally Official dot Com enjoy 
    the Sunday Times! Here's <BR>an excerpt from a Sunday Times article that 
    appeared in the same decade <BR>that a US President was assassinated. Please 
    examine this excerpt and <BR>tell us [1] who was the author? and [2] who was 
    the author referring to? <BR>Of course this is a toughie (you can *forget* 
    Google), but it's fair; <BR>and the excerpt provides all the needed 
    information. 
    <P>Here's the excerpt: 
    <P>"...Every time you get set he jabs you off balance by wanting to do a 
    <BR>love scene on top of the Jefferson Memorial or something like that. 
    <BR>...He has a strong feeling for stage business and mood and background, 
    <BR>not so much for the guts of the business. I guess that's why some of his 
    <BR>pictures lose their grip on logic and turn into wild chases. Well, it's 
    <BR>not the worst way to make a picture. His idea of characters is rather 
    <BR>primitive. Nice Young Man, Society Girl, Frightened Woman, Sneaky Old 
    <BR>Beldam, Spy, Comic Relief, and so on. But he is as nice as can be to 
    <BR>argue with..." 
    <P><BR>Panel hint if needed: Of course we could shower you with hints, or 
    bate <BR>you with tips. OK, here's a thought: a particular flower in a 
    particular <BR>pigment is used as a figure of speech in English usage to 
    mean <BR>"something impossible". Hope that helps! 
    <P><BR>Second Panel hint if needed: Of course we can provide another hint to 
    <BR>keep this question from going south. Rather than south, reverse your 
    <BR>direction by 180 degrees and then take that which is 45 degrees to your 
    <BR>left. That would be for air travel, for ground travel you might try a 
    <BR>train. Whilst on the train be careful that a bachelor with three sons 
    <BR>doesn't do something he will regret!
