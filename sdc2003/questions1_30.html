    <P>Notes: The requirement to name two words is a half-hearted hint to think 
    <BR>in pairs, specifically, a dichotomy. If this is too great a hint, the 
    <BR>editor is welcome to back it off to a single-word answer.

    <DIV class=question><B>Q:</B> I was born (in a city whose name means "Street 
    Fortress") in the same <BR>year that England declared war on Spain. My 
    surname means something like <BR>"Large Trees", or something like that. But 
    of course, I changed my name <BR>when I married an engineer in Paris, and 
    took his last name, which some <BR>say means, "Keeping Silent in the Desert" 
    (although others would dispute <BR>this etymology). I had a profession 
    whereby I enjoyed access to high <BR>society. One year after the English 
    fleet destroyed the Danish fleet in <BR>the harbour of Copenhagen, my 
    husband and I moved to London. I died in <BR>the year that Prussia and 
    Austria-Hungary received their constitutions <BR>"from above". A photograph

    notable battle. I <BR>turned right and proceeded south along a street whose 
    name commemorates <BR>a notable battle. I then made another right and 
    proceeded on a street <BR>whose name commemorates a notable battle. After 
    several moments, I <BR>turned left on a street whose name commemorates the 
    ending of a war. I <BR>turned right again and proceeded until I found myself 
    on a small street <BR>whose name commemorates a notable battle. Before me 
    was a street whose <BR>name ultimately comes from a Viking warlord. I saw a 
    memorial there, but <BR>it did not commemorate those who died there. Who

    invited 100 <BR>young people to a house party with the intent of marrying

    My father had <BR>the peculiar habit of arising very early in the morning to 
    pick fruit <BR>from the garden and hiding it throughout the house. When the 
    Crimean War <BR>broke out, I decided to build the largest hot-air balloon in 
    the world, <BR>fly it across Europe, and shoot at the Russian army from 
    above. Sadly, <BR>this plan never materialised. So I moved to Spain and 
    became a recluse <BR>in a hotel. I had my meals delivered to my room, but 
    never let anyone <BR>collect the crockery - when the room filled up with 
    dirty plates, I <BR>simply took a new room! When I died, my earldom became 
    extinct. Oddly <BR>enough, I am remembered as a great balloonist. Who am I?

    <DIV class=answer><B>A:</B> One or more characters called "abuelos" 
    (grandfathers), who crack <BR>whips, are among the masked dancers in the 
    Matachines dances of Hispanic <BR>America, at least in the northern Mexican 
    and southwestern U.S. <BR>versions. The bearer of the Claw is Severian, the 
    hero of Gene Wolfe's <BR>superb tetralogy _The Book of the New Sun_. 
    Starting life as a torturer <BR>in a science-fictional Commonwealth, he grew 
    up in the Matachin Tower, <BR>probably so named because the torturers wore 
    masks. The Mattachine or <BR>Matachine Society was a gay-rights group 
    founded in Los Angeles in 1950 <BR>and influential till the mid '60s. It was 
    named after the Societe <BR>Mattachine in medieval and renaissance France, 
    which presented masques, <BR>with reference to the hidden lives of gay men 
    at the time.
