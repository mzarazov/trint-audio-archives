       <p>People often have difficulty in deciding which words to use to describe
various geographical and political entities within the geographical area
known as the <a href="#britisles">British Isles</a> (including <a href="#ireland">Ireland</a>).
There are many pitfalls in the terminology, which can be politically sensitive.
The following aims to reduce the chance of unwittingly offending natives
of the area.</p>

          <p><b>BRITISH ISLES.</b> A geographical term referring to the islands
off the north-west coast of continental Europe, including the islands of
<a href="#greatbrit">Great Britain</a>, <a href="#ireland">Ireland</a>,
groups such as the outer and inner Hebrides, Shetlands and Orkneys, and
countless others. The southernmost islands&nbsp; are the <a href="#channel">Channel
Islands</a> (though these are not universally regarded as belonging to
the group), and the northernmost the Shetlands. Geographically the Faeroes
(which belong to Denmark) might be regarded as part of the archipelago,
but from an English usage standpoint they are not generally included in
the term. The use of "British" in this context does not indicate that all
the islands now belong to Britain, any more than the phrase "Irish Sea" implies
Irish sovereignty over that stretch of water. Many people in Ireland nevertheless 
dislike the phrase; unfortunately there is no alternative term likely to be widely
understood.</p>

Wales and Scotland. The usage goes back to Roman times ("Britannia Major",

of the official title of the <a href="#theunited">United Kingdom</a>, in
which case it means the political entities of England, Scotland, Wales,

of the possible confusion between these two usages, "the British mainland"

       <p><b>BRITAIN.</b> The informal name for the <a href="#theunited">United
Kingdom</a>. The following extract from the OED gives the historical background
to the usage:
       <p class="bq">"After the Old English period, Britain was used only as a historical term, until about the time of Henry VIII and Edward
        VI, when it came again into practical politics in connexion with the efforts made to unite England and Scotland; in 1604 James I was
        proclaimed 'King of Great Britain'; and this name was adopted for the United Kingdom, at the Union in 1707."

       <a NAME="british"></a>
       <p><b>BRITISH</b> is the formal designation of the nationality of citizens
of the <a href="#theunited">United Kingdom</a>, and of certain others.
Unexceptionable when used to describe the English, Scottish or Welsh, but
not to be used about those referring to themselves as Irish. See also <a href="#northern">NORTHERN
IRELAND</a>.
</p>
       <hr>
       <a NAME="briton"></a>
       <p><b>BRITON, BRITISHER, BRIT.</b> None of these nouns is universally
acceptable. The first is now rarely heard, and verges on the archaic; the
second is widely perceived as a non-native usage; the third is colloquial,
and like the second may be regarded as disparaging by some.
</p>

       <a NAME="england"></a>
       <p><b>ENGLAND.</b> The biggest and most populous of the four countries
making up the <a href="#theunited">United Kingdom</a>, and historically
the most powerful. The main pitfall with the word and its adjective, "English",
is its unwitting use as a substitute for "Britain". This gives offence
to most people from Wales, Scotland and <a href="#northern">Northern Ireland</a>.
"Englander", except in the political epithet "little Englander", is regarded
as a non-native usage.

The official name for the nation informally referred to as <a href="#britain">Britain</a>.
Often abbreviated to "the UK". The term "United Kingdom" only became the
official title in 1801, when the Act of Ireland united Britain and Ireland.
It had however been in use since 1707, when the Act of Union incorporated
Scotland with England and Wales into the United Kingdom of Great Britain.

          <p><b>IRELAND.</b> As used by geographers, the second largest island
of the British Isles. Also the title in English of the independent republic 
which occupies 84% of the land area of the island. In the Irish language this 
state is called &Eacute;ire, a name which is not recommended for use in English, 
though it is often heard. From 1922 to 1937 it was called the Irish Free State 
(Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann), a term still used by some but now carrying 
political overtones and therefore to be avoided except in historical 
contexts. In many contexts it will be clear to the listener or reader 
whether "Ireland" means the whole island or just the Republic. Where 
it is necessary to distinguish between the two possibilities, use "the 
Republic of Ireland", which has the advantage of being endorsed by the 
Irish government itself. (One or two Irish readers of this guide have queried 
that statement in the past. A thorough justification of it can be found in 
the footnote <a href="ireland.html">The Correct Name For Ireland</a>.) "The Irish Republic" is 
an informal version often heard. One also sometimes hears "Southern 
Ireland" or "the South" referring to the Republic. Neither 
term is recommended; they may give offence, and they are inaccurate, since the 
northernmost point of the island is in County Donegal, in the Republic. They 
could also be taken to mean that part of the island south of, say, the Wicklow 
hills.

       <a NAME="northern"></a>
       <p><b>NORTHERN IRELAND</b> This is not the place to go into
the complex history and political circumstances of Northern Ireland, except
so far as necessary to describe the linguistic pitfalls which arise from
them. The north-east portion of the island of Ireland is part of the <a href="#theunited">United
Kingdom</a>, and is officially called Northern Ireland. Whilst nearly all
of those who live there are legally British citizens, strangers are advised
to avoid using the adjective "British" in relation to someone from Northern
Ireland unless they are sure it will not be resented. Those who favour
unification of the province with the Republic of Ireland are more likely
to refer to it as "the north of Ireland" or "the six counties". Northern
Ireland is sometimes also referred to as "Ulster", the name of one of the
four historical kingdoms (later provinces) of Ireland, but to do so may
also be regarded as politically contentious; the modern borders of NI do
not coincide with the historical borders of Ulster, which included three
other counties now in the Republic.</p>
       <p>Whilst generally speaking it is the Roman Catholics who are in favour
of a merger with the Irish Republic, and the Protestants who desire a continuation
of the union with Britain, it is advisable to use the terms "Nationalist"
and "Unionist" respectively as the most neutral terms for the two bodies
of opinion. "Republican" tends to be used for that sector of the Catholic/nationalist
population that supports the IRA and its political arm, Sinn Fein, whilst
"Loyalist" is often applied to members and supporters of Protestant/unionist
paramilitary groups.

       <p><b>CHANNEL ISLANDS, ISLE OF MAN.</b> Note that the Isle of Man
(adjective: Manx) and the Channel Islands (i.e. the separate bailiwicks of
Guernsey and Jersey) are not part of the United Kingdom, but are classified as
Crown Dependencies. They each have their own legislature, system of laws,
and taxation, and they are not represented in the UK Parliament. Nor are
they members of the European Union, though they do have special trading
rights with it. The UK is responsible for their defence and for their international
relations, and the inhabitants of all the islands are British citizens
with the right of abode in the UK.

       <hr>
       <a NAME="scotch"></a>
       <p><b>SCOTCH.</b> The following is extracted from Mark Israel's FAQ
for alt.usage.english:
       <pre>
    Scots' preferred adjective for Scotland and for themselves is
    "Scots". "Scottish" is also acceptable. But "Scotch" (although
    used by Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott, and still used by some
    Americans of Scots descent) is now considered offensive by many
    Scots. Certain Scots hold that only three things can be "Scotch":
    "Scotch whisky", "Scotch egg", and "Scotch mist". They are not
    interested in considering additions to this list, although many
    other terms containing "Scotch" can be found in dictionaries.
								
    The term "Scotch tape" (a trademark for clear sticky tape made by
    the 3M company, based in Minnesota) was originally a reference to
    the stereotype of Scots miserliness. 3M at one time made a tape with
    no adhesive along the middle. The tape was intended as a masking
    tape for painting cars (masking off areas that you didn't want to
    paint), so 3M thought it didn't need a full sticky coating; but
    customers were not impressed.
