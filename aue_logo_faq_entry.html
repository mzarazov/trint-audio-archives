       <!-- faqshortname AUE Logo -->
       <p>As most AUE readers probably know, AUE has a totally official logo. This logo adorns the breast of  the AUEers who have managed to acquire a Totally Official AUE tee shirt. (If you want to be among the breast
adorners, watch AUE postings for the announcement of a boink. Instructions
for obtaining a tee shirt will be included in the announcement.) The logo image is also scaled down and used  as a banner for the
<a href="index.shtml">home page</a> of this AUE Web site, and 
a rather larger version adorns this page.
But these reductions don't do it justice &#8211; if you can stand a 750 Kb download and an image that probably won't fit on your screen, feast your eyes on the details of <a href="AUE_logo/aueLogoMasterImage.jpg" class="sml %l">the full-size logo</a>.
       <p>The history of the logo is shrouded in  mystery. I've been told
that it came to us from an earlier generation of AUE contributors &#8211; dates as early as 
1992 have been mentioned. My
informant chose not to tell me their names, just that they were amateurs and hobbyists 
who created something for AUE.
       <p>Part of the lore associated with the logo has to do 
with conditions for its use that have also been handed down from our logo-fathers. 
Here is a statement by a present-day AUE member who prefers to remain anonymous and who 
is much more knowledgeable about logo lore than I am:

       <pre>
     Usage Conventions
     -----------------
     Our logo may be used freely on any 'on-topic' page or article mounted by
     an aue contributor. It may also be used freely by webmasters and page
     designers to contain a hyper-link that points to [this site's home page], or
     by other media for articles that pertain directly to alt.usage.english;
     and we encourage its use in this context because it promotes
     recognizability. Use of this logo for profit, or in a context that
     embarrasses alt.usage.english is prohibited. Further questions on the
     use of the Totally Official aue Logo can be answered by posting an inquiry
     at &lt;<a href="news:alt.usage.english">news:alt.usage.english</a>&gt;.
</pre>
       <p>The logo has aesthetic appeal, but just what its original creators meant it
to represent is unknown to me. I asked an AUE contributor who 
also prefers to remain anonymous to give me a summary of his impressions as 
he looked at the logo. Here is his response:</p>
        
       
        
       <p class="bq">The logo shows three galaxies. The OED defines galaxy as 'independent
systems of stars held together by gravitational attraction', 'a
brilliant company or gathering'. Three galaxies might be taken as a
metaphor for the three major English speaking land masses. 
<img align="right" vspace=20 hspace=20 src="auebob_80.jpg" alt="The aue logo">
I count six instances of lens flare in the logo. They are more or less
equally distributed throughout the image. I would take this to
represent technology, such as that offered by Usenet.</p>
       <p class="bq">The lettering appears to be taken from a traditional engraver's font,
which evokes the sense of 'Old English', while still retaining clarity.
This lettering style, combined with the lens flare, provides a striking
juxtaposition of traditional and technical.</p>
       <p class="bq">Finally, there is a border around the scene that uses an agate texture.
The highly variegated texture might suggest the diversified nature of
the English language.</p>
       <p>This webmaster particularly likes the border.
